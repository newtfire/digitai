In particular, they specify a set of markers (or tags) which may be inserted in the electronic representation of the text, in order to mark the text structure and other features of interest. Many, or most, computer programs depend on the presence of such explicit markers for their functionality, since without them a digitized text appears to be nothing but a sequence of undifferentiated bits. The success of the World Wide Web, for example, is partly a consequence of its use of such markup to indicate such features as headings and lists on individual pages, and to indicate links between pages. The process of inserting such explicit markers for implicit textual features is often called markup, or equivalently within this work encoding; the term tagging is also used informally. We use the term encoding scheme or markup language to denote the complete set of rules associated with the use of markup in a given context; we use the term markup vocabulary for the specific set of markers or named distinctions employed by a given encoding scheme. Thus, this work both describes the TEI encoding scheme, and documents the TEI markup vocabulary.",

Consequently, the TEI Guidelines make (with relatively rare exceptions) no suggestions or restrictions as to the relative importance of textual features. The philosophy of these Guidelines is if you want to encode this feature, do it this way—but very few features are mandatory. In the same spirit, while these Guidelines very rarely require you to encode any particular feature, they do require you to be honest about which features you have encoded, that is, to respect the meanings and usage rules they recommend for specific elements and attributes proposed.",

By contrast, the TEI is intended for use in a large number of rather ill-defined and often overlapping domains.

Such consensus has been, and no doubt will be, subject to change. The TEI Guidelines do not make suggestions or restrictions as to which of these features should be encoded.

These Guidelines offer the possibility of encoding many different views of the text, simultaneously if necessary. Where different views of the formal structure of a text are required, as opposed to different annotations on a single structural view, however, the formal syntax of XML (which requires a single hierarchical view of text structure) poses some problems; recommendations concerning ways of overcoming or circumventing that restriction are discussed in chapter #NH (Non-hierarchical Structures) .",

Clearly, however, if we wish to exchange our poems with others, or to include poems others have marked up in our anthology, we will need to know a bit more about the names used for the tags. The means that XML provides for this is called a namespace. In our simple example, the tags just contain a simple name. As we shall see, it is also possible to use tags that include a qualified name, that is, a name with an optional prefix identifying the set of names to which it belongs. For example, we have defined an element line for the purpose of marking lines of verse. Another person might, however, define an element called line for the purpose of marking typographic lines, or drawn lines. Because of these different meanings, if we wish to share data it will be necessary to distinguish the two line components in our marked-up texts. This is achieved by including a namespace prefix within the markup, for example like this: <my:line>This is one of my lines<\/my:line> <!-- ... --> <yr:line>This is one of your lines<\/yr:line> This feature is particularly important if we have different definitions of what a line is, of course, but there are many occasions when it is useful to distinguish groups of tags belonging to different markup vocabularies; we discuss this further below (#SGname (Namespaces) ).

It might well be useful if, in the process of preparing our digital anthology, a computer system could check some basic rules about how stanzas, lines, and headings can sensibly co-occur in a document. It would be even more useful if the system could check that stanzas are always tagged stanza and not occasionally canto or Stanza. An XML document in which such rules have been checked is technically known as a valid document, and the ability to perform such validation is one of the key advantages of using XML. To carry this out, some way of formally stating the criteria for successful validation is necessary: in XML this formal statement is provided by an additional document known as a schema.The older terms Document Type Declaration and Document Type Definition, both abbreviated as DTD, may also be encountered.

Many of the earliest projects that fed into the TEI were shaped in this developmental phase of the computerized representation of texts, and it was also the context in which SGML was devised and finalized.",

This means, among other things, that the actual repertoire of characters which the standard encodes, especially those parts dating from its earlier days, include a number of items which on a strict interpretation of the Unicode Consortium's theoretical approach should not have been regarded as abstract characters in their own right. Some of these characters are grouped together into a code-point regions assigned to compatibility characters. Ligatures are a case in point. Ligatures (e.g. the joining of adjacent lowercase letters s and t or f and i in Latin scripts, whether produced by a scribal practice of not lifting the pen between strokes or dictated by the aesthetics of a type design) are representational features with no added semantic value beyond that of the two letters they unite (though for historians of typography their presence and form in a given edition may be of scholarly significance). However, by the time the Unicode standard was first being debated, it had become common practice to include single glyphs representing the more common ligatures in the repertoires of some typesetting devices and high-end printers, and for the coded character sets built into those devices to use a single code point for such glyphs, even though they represent two distinct abstract characters. So as to increase the acceptance of Unicode among the makers and users of such devices, it was agreed that some such pseudo-characters should be incorporated into the standard as compatibility characters. Nevertheless, if a project requires the presence of such ligatured forms to be encoded, this should normally be done via markup, not by the use of a compatibility character. That way, the presence of the ligature can still be identified (and, if desired, rendered visually) where appropriate, but indexing and retrieval software will treat the code points in the document as a simple sequential occurrence of the two constituent characters concerned and so correctly align their semantics with non-ligatured equivalents. Such ligatures should not be confused with digraphs (usually) indicating diphthongs, as in the French word \"cœur\". A digraph is an atomic orthographic unit representing an abstract character in its own right, not purely an amalgamation of glyphs, and indexing and retrieval software will need to treat it as such. Where a digraph occurs in a source text, it should normally be encoded using the appropriate code point for the single abstract character which it represents.",

It is obvious enough that it would be feasible to represent many characters with diacritical marks in Latin and some other scripts by a sequence of code points, where one code point designated the base character and the remainder represented one or more diacritical marks that were to be combined with the base character to produce an appropriate glyphic rendering of the abstract character concerned. From its earliest phase, the Unicode Consortium espoused this view in theory but was prepared in practice to compromise by assigning single code points to precomposed characters which were already commonly assigned a single distinctive code point in existing encoding schemes. This means, however, that for quite a large number of commonly-occurring abstract characters, Unicode has two different, but logically and semantically equivalent encodings: a precomposed single code point, and a code point sequence of a base character plus one or more combining diacritics. Scripts more recently added to Unicode no longer exhibit this code-point duplication (in current practice no new precomposed characters are defined where the use of combining characters is possible) but this does nothing to remove the problem caused by the duplications from older character sets that have been permanently embodied in Unicode. Together with essentially analogous issues arising from the encoding of certain East Asian ideographs. This duplication gives rise to the need to practice normalization of Unicode documents. Normalization is the process of ensuring that a given abstract character is represented in one way only in a given Unicode document or document collection. The Unicode Consortium provides four standard normalization forms, of which the Normalization Form C (NFC) seems to be most appropriate for text encoding projects.

That is why a document which is actually encoded in pure 7-bit ASCII can be fed to an XML processor without alteration and without its encoding being explicitly declared: the processor will regard it as being in the UTF-8 representation of Unicode and be able to handle it correctly on that basis.",

Abstract characters that have a single byte code point where the highest bit is set (that is, they have a decimal numeric representation between 129 and 255) are encoded in ISO-8859-n as a single byte with the same value as the code point. But in UTF-8 code-point values inside that range are expressed as a two byte sequence. That is to say, the abstract character in question is no longer represented in the file or in memory by the same number as its code-point value: it is transformed (hence the T in UTF) into a sequence of two different numbers. Now as a side-effect of the way such UTF-8 sequences are derived from the underlying code-point value, many of the single-byte eight-bit values employed in ISO-8859-n encodings are illegal in UTF-8.",

Explicitly declaring the encoding ought to solve the problem, and if the file is correctly encoded throughout, it will do so. But projects dealing with documents of sufficient age may find that they have to deal with some files encoded in UTF-8 along with others in, say, ISO-8859-1. Such encoding differences may go unnoticed, especially if the proportion of characters where the internal encodings are distinguishable is relatively small (for example in a long English text with a smattering of French words).

The term computer file here is to be understood as referring to the whole entity or document described by the header, even when this is stored in several distinct operating system files. The file description also includes information about the source or sources from which the electronic document was derived. The TEI elements used to encode the file description are described in section #HD2 (The File Description) below. an encoding description, tagged encodingDesc, which describes the relationship between an electronic text and its source or sources. It allows for detailed description of whether (or how) the text was normalized during transcription, how the encoder resolved ambiguities in the source, what levels of encoding or analysis were applied, and similar matters. The TEI elements used to encode the encoding description are described in section #HD5 (The Encoding Description) below. a text profile, tagged profileDesc, containing classificatory and contextual information about the text, such as its subject matter, the situation in which it was produced, the individuals described by or participating in producing it, and so forth. Such a text profile is of particular use in highly structured composite texts such as corpora or language collections, where it is often highly desirable to enforce a controlled descriptive vocabulary or to perform retrievals from a body of text in terms of text type or origin. The text profile may however be of use in any form of automatic text processing. The TEI elements used to encode the profile description are described in section #HD4 (The Profile Description) below. a container element, tagged xenoData, which allows easy inclusion of metadata from non-TEI schemes (i.e., other than elements in the TEI namespace). For example, the MARC record for the encoded document might be included using MARCXML or MODS. A simple set of metadata for harvesting might be included encoded in Dublin Core. a revision history, tagged revisionDesc, which allows the encoder to provide a history of changes made during the development of the electronic text.

Many elements may contain either prose (possibly organized into paragraphs) or more specific elements, which themselves contain prose. In this chapter's descriptions of element content, the phrase prose description should be understood to imply a series of paragraphs, each marked as a p element. The word phrase, by contrast, should be understood to imply character data, interspersed as need be with phrase-level elements, but not organized into paragraphs. For more information on paragraphs, highlighted phrases, lists, etc., see section #COPA (Paragraphs) . grouping elements Elements whose names end with the suffix Stmt (e.g. editionStmt, titleStmt) and the xenoData element enclose a group of specialized elements recording some structured information. In the case of the bibliographic elements, the suffix Stmt is used in names of elements corresponding to the areas of the International Standard Bibliographic Description. For more information on this highly influential family of standards, first proposed in 1969 by the International Federation of Library Associations, see http:\/\/www.ifla.org\/VII\/s13\/pubs\/isbd.htm () . On the relation between the TEI proposals and other standards for bibliographic description, see further section #HD8 (Note for Library Cataloguers) . In the case of the xenoData element, the specialized elements are not TEI elements, but rather come from some other metadata scheme. In most cases grouping elements may contain prose descriptions as an alternative to the set of specialized elements, thus allowing the encoder to choose whether or not the information concerned should be presented in a structured form or in prose. declarations Elements whose names end with the suffix Decl (e.g. tagsDecl, refsDecl) enclose information about specific encoding practices applied in the electronic text; often these practices are described in coded form. Typically, such information takes the form of a series of declarations, identifying a code with some more complex structure or description. A declaration which applies to more than one text or division of a text need not be repeated in the header of each such text or subdivision. Instead, the decls attribute of each text (or subdivision of the text) to which the declaration applies may be used to supply a cross-reference to it, as further described in section #CCAS (Associating Contextual Information with a Text) . descriptions Elements whose names end with the suffix Desc (e.g. settingDesc, projectDesc) contain a prose description, possibly, but not necessarily, organized under some specific headings by suggested sub-elements.",

If so, were corrections made silently or are they marked using the tags described in section #COED (Simple Editorial Changes) ? What principles have been adopted with respect to omissions, truncations, dubious corrections, alternate readings, false starts, repetitions, etc.? normalization Was the text normalized, for example by regularizing any non-standard spellings, dialect forms, etc.? If so, were normalizations performed silently or are they marked using the tags described in section #COED (Simple Editorial Changes) ? What authority was used for the regularization? Also, what principles were used when normalizing numbers to provide the standard values for the value attribute described in section #CONANU (Numbers and Measures) and what format used for them? punctuation Are punctuation marks present in the original source retained? Are they identified with the element pc, or implied by markup? If retained, how are they placed with respect to related elements? For example, do commas and periods appear inside or outside elements marking phrases and sentences? quotation How were quotation marks processed? Are apostrophes and quotation marks distinguished? How? Are quotation marks retained as content in the text or replaced by markup? Are there any special conventions regarding for example the use of single or double quotation marks when nested? Is the file consistent in its practice or has this not been checked? See section #COHQQ (Quotation) for discussion of ways in which quotation marks may be encoded. hyphenation Does the encoding distinguish soft and hard hyphens? What principle has been adopted with respect to end-of-line hyphenation where source lineation has not been retained? Have soft hyphens been silently removed, and if so what is the effect on lineation and pagination? See section #COPU-2 (Hyphenation) for discussion of ways in which hyphenation may be encoded. segmentation How is the text segmented? If s or seg segmentation units have been used to divide up the text for analysis, how are they marked and how was the segmentation arrived at? stdVals In most cases, attributes bearing standardized values (such as the when or when-iso attribute on dates) should conform to a defined W3C or ISO datatype. In cases where this is not appropriate, this element may be used to describe the standardization methods underlying the values supplied. interpretation Has any analytic or interpretive information been provided—that is, information which is felt to be non-obvious, or potentially contentious? If so, how was it generated? How was it encoded? If feature-structure analysis has been used, are fsdDecl elements (section #FD (Feature System Declaration) ) present?",

The TEI header is not a library catalogue record, and so will not make all of the distinctions essential in standard library work. It also includes much information generally excluded from standard bibliographic descriptions. It is the intention of the developers, however, to ensure that the information required for a catalogue record be retrievable from the TEI file header, and moreover that the mapping from the one to the other be as simple and straightforward as possible. Where the correspondence is not obvious, it may prove useful to consult one of the works which were influential in developing the content of the TEI header. These include:ISBD ISBD: International Standard Bibliographic Description is an international standard setting out what information should be recorded in a description of a bibliographical item. Until a consolidated edition published in 2011, there was a general standard called ISBD(G) and separate ISBDs covering different types of material, e.g. ISBD(M) for monographs, ISBD(ER) for electronic resources. These separate ISBDs follow the same general scheme as the main ISBD(G), but provide appropriate interpretations for the specific materials under consideration. AACR2 The Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (second edition) were published in 1978, with revisions appearing periodically through 2005. AACR2 provides guidelines for the construction of catalogues in general libraries in the English-speaking world. AACR2 is explicitly based on the general framework of the ISBD(G) and the subsidiary ISBDs: it gives a description of how to describe bibliographic items and how to create access points such as subject or name headings and uniform titles. Other national cataloguing codes exist as well, including the Z44 series of standards from issued by the Association française de normalisation (AFNOR), Regeln für die alphabetische Katalogisierung in wissenschaftlichen Bibliotheken (RAK-WB), Regole italiane di catalogazione per autore (RICA), and Система стандартов по информации, библиотечному и издательскому делу. Библиографическая запись. Библиографическое описание. Общие требования и правила составления (ГОСТ 7.1). ANSI Z39.29 The American National Standard for Bibliographic References was an American national standard governing bibliographic references for use in bibliographies, end-of-work lists, references in abstracting and indexing publications, and outputs from computerized bibliographic data bases. A revised version is maintained by the National Information Standards Organization (NISO). The related ISO standard is ISO 690.

However, cataloguers should be aware that the permissive nature of the TEI Guidelines may lead to divergences between practice in using the TEI file description and the comparatively strict recommendations of AACR2 and other national cataloguing codes. Such divergences as the following may preclude automatic generation of catalogue records from TEI headers: The TEI Guidelines do not require that text be transcribed from the chief source of information using normalized capitalization and punctuation . The TEI title statement may not categorize constituent titles in the same way as prescribed by a national cataloguing code. The TEI title statement contains authors, editors, and other responsible parties in separate elements, with names which may not have been normalized; it does not necessarily contain a single statement of responsibility . There is no specific place in a TEI header to specify the main entry or added entries (name or title headings under which a catalogue record is filed) for the catalogue record.

Billiard hall with two ruby glosses. 国文学研究資料館所蔵：：英国／龍動新繁昌記. This example is intriguing in that the right-side ruby glosses apply to the first and second characters respectively, but the left-side gloss applies to the whole word as a unit. We use this instance to exemplify multiple approaches to encoding the same phenomena, which may be appropriate for different projects or editorial preferences. First, using the same segmentation approach as demonstrated for 大学 above, but with nesting: 打 ダ 球 キウ 場 ビリヤード We could also use a standoff approach with anchor elements and pointers: 打 球 場 ビリヤード ダ キウ Alternatively, if the encoding itself already includes segmentation below the word level, we can use the existing elements instead of adding anchors: 打球場 ビリヤード ダ キウ Multiple ruby annotations can appear in the same alignment relative to the main text. For example, there might be two annotations on the right. We use this instance to exemplify two ways of encoding this phenomenon, dependent on the interpretation of the text. We could use a parallel approach where a sequence of two rt elements, both with the same value for the place attribute, are assumed to appear in their document sequence. The first of the two rt elements would appear to the right of the ruby base (rb), while the second would appear to the right of the first rt element Taken from Wikipedia.: ㄅ B 博 Alternatively, a nested approach can be used.

Second, biblFull and fileDesc use the child element publicationStmt to cover not only the publication, production, distribution, etc. area but also the resource identifier and terms of availability area associated with that publication. Despite these inconsistencies, users encoding citations and attempting to format them according to a standard that closely adheres to ISBD may find that biblFull, used with its child elements and without delimiting punctuation, provides an appropriate granularity of encoding with elements that can easily be rendered for the reader. However, it is important to note that some ISBD-derived citation formats (such as ANSI\/NISO Z39.29 and ГОСТ 7.1) are not entirely conformant to ISBD either, since they may begin with a statement of authorship that does not map to the ISBD statement of responsibility.",

Where a metrical line is interrupted by the start of a new typographic line, the encoder may choose to ignore the fact entirely or to use the empty lb (line beginning) element discussed in #CORS (Reference Systems) . By convention, the start of a metrical line implies the start of a typographic line; hence there is no need to introduce an lb tag at the start of every l element, but only at places where a new typographic line starts within a metrical line, as in the following example: Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast Brought Death into the World, and all our woe, With loss of Eden, till one greater Man Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat... In the original copy text, the presence of an ornamental capital at the start of the poem means that the measure is not wide enough to print the first four lines on four lines; instead each metrical line occupies two typographic lines, with the second beginning at the point indicated. Note that this encoding makes no attempt to preserve information about the whitespace or indentation associated with either kind of line; if regarded as essential, this information would be recorded using the rend or rendition attributes discussed in #STGA (Global Attributes) .",

B. eine eingebettete oder zitierte Erzählung. Für diesen Zweck wird das Element floatingText benutzt. #DS (Default Text Structure) #CCDEF (Varieties of Composite Text)",

Within each line, individual characters are frequently presented from left to right (English, Russian, Greek), but there are also several widely-used scripts which run right-to-left (Arabic, Hebrew). Writing in which the lines of glyphs are presented vertically and read from right to left is also often encountered, notably in East Asian scripts (Sinitic characters, Japanese Kana, Korean Hangul, Vietnamese chữ nôm). In many cases, a language normally uses the same writing mode (we use this term to refer to the orientation of individual glyphs within a line and the order in which glyphs and lines should be read), but there are exceptions in which the same language may appear in different modes, for example either vertically or horizontally. Many East Asian scripts were traditionally written from top to bottom within the line, with their lines sequenced from right to left. Although modern Japanese, Chinese, and Korean are often written horizontally, the traditional vertical writing mode is still widely used. There are also comparatively rare cases of ancient scripts written with lines running left to right, each line being read top to bottom (Ancient Uighur, classical Mongolian and Manchu), or scripts such as Ogham where the writing direction may start from the bottom left and run around the edge of an inscribed object.",

For example, when Japanese is written horizontally, the Unicode character U+3001, the ideographic comma, is used in preference to Unicode character U+FE11, the vertical mode comma. This ensures that the comma appears in the correct position relative to the surrounding glyphs. Even for scripts which are usually written in exactly the same way, different writing modes may be encountered in particular contexts; for example when a language using Roman script is embedded within vertically-organized Chinese text, it may sometimes be displayed vertically and sometimes horizontally. The writing mode may also vary in response to layout constraints such as those imposed by a complex table, where column or row labels may be written vertically or diagonally to make the most effective use of available space, just as it may vary in response to the size and shape of the carrier in the case of a monumental inscription.",

This has obvious advantages of simplicity, but the disadvantage that any deviation from metrical convention is not marked at its precise point of occurrence in the text. Greater precision may be achieved, but only at the cost of marking deviant metrical units explicitly. This may be done with the seg element, giving the variant realization as the value of the real attribute on that element. Using this method, the example given immediately above might be encoded as follows: A needless alexandrine ends the song, That, like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along. The marking of the foot boundaries with the symbol | in the met attribute value of the l element allows the human reader, or a sufficiently intelligent software program, to isolate the correct portion of that attribute value as the default value for the same attribute on the seg elements for feet, namely -+. It is of course up to the encoder to decide whether or not to include the n attribute of seg here, and whether or not also to tag the feet in the line in which there is no deviation from the metrical convention. The ability of software to infer which foot is being marked, if not all are tagged, will depend heavily on the language of the text and the knowledge of prosody built into the software; the fuller and more explicit the markup, the easier it will be for software to handle it. It may prove useful, however, to mark metrical deviations in the manner shown, even if the available software is not sufficiently intelligent to scan lines without aid from the markup.

The discussion in the remainder of this chapter assumes that it is the speech-based hierarchy which most prominently determines the structure of performance texts, but the same mechanisms could be employed to encode a view of a performance text in which individual speeches were entirely subordinate to the formal units of prose and verse.

This reflects the special difficulties which apply to the encoding or transcription of speech. Speech varies according to a large number of dimensions, many of which have no counterpart in writing (for example, tempo, loudness, pitch, etc.). The audibility of speech recorded in natural communication situations is often less than perfect, affecting the accuracy of the transcription. Spoken material may be transcribed in the course of linguistic, acoustic, anthropological, psychological, ethnographic, journalistic, or many other types of research. Even in the same field, the interests and theoretical perspectives of different transcribers may lead them to prefer different levels of detail in the transcript and different styles of visual display. The production and comprehension of speech are intimately bound up with the situation in which speech occurs, far more so than is the case for written texts. A speech transcript must therefore include some contextual features; determining which are relevant is not always simple. Moreover, the ethical problems in recording and making public what was produced in a private setting and intended for a limited audience are more frequently encountered in dealing with spoken texts than with written ones.",

Its beginning and end may be hard to determine and its internal composition difficult to define. Most researchers agree that the utterances or turns of individual speakers form an important structural component in most kinds of speech, but these are rarely as well-behaved (in the structural sense) as paragraphs or other analogous units in written texts: speakers frequently interrupt each other, use gestures as well as words, leave remarks unfinished and so on. Speech itself, though it may be represented as words, frequently contains items such as vocalized pauses which, although only semi-lexical, have immense importance in the analysis of spoken text. Even non-vocal elements such as gestures may be regarded as forming a component of spoken text for some analytic purposes. Below the level of the individual utterance, speech may be segmented into units defined by phonological, prosodic, or syntactic phenomena; no clear agreement exists, however, even as to appropriate names for such segments.",

We term this type of unit a post. Posts occur in two different variants: as written or multimodal posts, which are produced with an editor form that is designed for the composition of stretches of written text. Most contemporary post-based CMC technologies provide features for the inclusion of graphic and audio-visual content (emoji graphics, images, videos) into posts and even to produce posts without verbal content (which then may consist only of emojis, an image, or a video file). Written and multimodal posts are the standard formats for user contributions in primarily text-based CMC genres and applications such as chat, SMS, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, X (Twitter), online forums, or Wikipedia talk pages. as audio posts, which are produced using a recording function. In contrast to CMC units of the type utterance which are produced and transmitted simultaneously, audio posts first have to be recorded as a whole and are then transmitted, as audio files, via the internet; the availability of the recording is indicated in the screen protocol by a template-generated, visual post; the recipients can play the recording (repeatedly) by activating the play button displayed in the post on the screen.

However, other users will be interested primarily in capturing the lexical information in a dictionary in a form suitable for further processing, which may demand the expansion or rearrangement of the information contained in the printed form. Further, some users wish to encode both of these views of the data, and retain the links between related elements of the two encodings.

Any of the top-level constituents (def, usg, form, etc.) can appear at any level (i.e., within entries, homographs, or senses). Because an entry can now occur inside an entry, the superEntry element is no longer needed. For instances where the superEntry element was used to group multiple entry elements, these Guidelines recommend using instead an outer entry element, perhaps with a type attribute. super entry groupe d'entrées groups a sequence of entries within any kind of lexical resource, such as a dictionary or lexicon which function as a single unit, for example a set of homographs. 동형이의어 집합의 연속된 표제 항목을 모아 놓는다. 匯集一組同形異義字的連續辭條。 同形異義語の集合にある、一連の項目をまとめる。 regroupe des entrées successives pour un ensemble d'homographes. agrupa las entradas sucesivas para una serie de homógrafos. raggruppa voci successive per una serie di omografi. abandon a|ban|don @\"band@n v T1 to leave completely and for ever ... n U the state when one's feelings and actions are uncontrolled; freedom from control homme hom|me óm n.

No restrictions are placed on the method used to construct xml:ids; one convenient method is to use the orthographic form of the headword, appending a disambiguating number where necessary. Identification codes are sometimes included on machine-readable tapes of dictionaries for in-house use. It is recommended to use the sense element even for an entry that has only one sense to group together all parts of the definition relating to the word sense since this leads to more consistent encoding across entries. Comme tous les éléments, entry hérite d'un attribut xml:id issu de la classe global. Aucune restriction n'est donnée quant à la méthode utilisée pour construire les xml:id ; une méthode commode consiste à utiliser la forme orthographique de l'entrée en y ajoutant un nombre si nécessaire, pour éviter toute ambiguïté. Pour un usage interne, des codes d'identification sont parfois inclus sur les enregistements électroniques des dictionnaires. 他の要素と同じく、要素entryは、クラスglobal から属性xml:idを継承している。属性xml:idを使 用する際の制約はない。見出し語には正書形を使うのがよい。必要であれ ば、曖昧性のない番号を付加してもよい。識別コードには、組織内で使用 される機械可読テープにある辞書でも使用されることがある。 #DIBO (Dictionary Body and Overall Structure) #DIEN (The Structure of Dictionary Entries) unstructured entry 구조화되지 않은 표제 항목 entrada no estructurada entrée libre voce non strutturata contains a single unstructured entry in any kind of lexical resource, such as a dictionary or lexicon. entry 요소에 의해 부과된 제약에 반드시 부합할 필요 없는 사전 표제 항목을 포함한다. 所包含的辭條項目未必符合元素entry該有的限制條件。 要素entryにある制約に必ずしも従わない辞書項目を示す。 contient une entrée de dictionnaire qui ne se conforme pas nécessairement aux contraintes imposées par l’élément entry. contiene una entrada de diccionario no necesariamente conforme con las restricciones impuestas por el elemento entry (entrada). contiene una voce di dizionario non necessariamente conforme ai vincoli imposti dall'elemento entry. biryani or biriani (%bIrI\"A:nI) any of a variety of Indian dishes ...

The latter does not require the first sense of hôtellerie to have an identifier, and retains the print form of the cross-reference; by omitting the target attribute of the ref element, however, the second example does assume implicitly either that some software could usefully parse the phrase tagged as a ref and find the location referred to, or else that such processing will not be necessary.",

Where a title does not imply the author, and is thus insufficient to identify the main text of a manuscript, the author should be stated explicitly (e.g. Augustinus, Sermones or Cicero, Letters). Many inventories of manuscripts consist of no more than an author and title, with some form of copy-specific identifier, such as a shelfmark or secundo folio reference (e.g. Arch. B. 3. 2: Evangelium Matthei cum glossa, 126. Isidori Originum libri octo, Biblia Hieronimi, 2o fo. opus est); information on date and place of writing will sometimes also be included. The standard TEI element head element can be used to provide a brief description of this kind. In this way the cataloguer or scholar can supply in one place a minimum of essential information, such as might be displayed or printed as the heading of a full description. For example: Marsilius de Inghen, Abbreviata phisicorum Aristotelis; Italy, 1463. Any phrase-level elements, such as title, name, date, or the specialized elements origPlace and origDate, can also be used within a head element, but it should be remembered that the head element is intended principally to contain a heading.

The text of this manuscript is not interpolated with sentences from Royal decrees promulgated in 1294, 1305 and 1314. In the margins, however, another somewhat later scribe has added the relevant paragraphs of these decrees, see pp. 8, 24, 44, 47 etc. As a humorous gesture the scribe in one opening of the manuscript, pp. 36 and 37, has prolonged the lower stems of one letter f and five letters þ and has them drizzle down the margin. Spaces for initials and chapter headings were left by the scribe but not filled in. A later, probably fifteenth-century, hand has added initials and chapter headings in greenish-coloured ink on fols 8r, 8v, 9r, 10r and 11r. Although a few of these chapter headings are now rather difficult to read, most can be made out, e.g. fol. 8rb floti astridar; fol. 9rb vm olaf conung, and fol. 10ra Gipting olafs konungs. The manuscript contains the following marginalia: Fol. 4v, left margin: hialmadr ok brynjadr, in a fifteenth-century hand, imitating an addition made to the text by the scribe at this point.

This chapter defines a module for use in encoding such an apparatus of variants, which may be used in conjunction with any of the modules defined in these Guidelines. It also defines an element class which provides extra attributes for some elements of the core tag set when this module is selected. In printed critical editions, the apparatus takes the form of highly-compressed notes at the bottom of each page. TEI’s critical apparatus module allows variation to be encoded so that such notes may be generated, but it also models the variation so that, for example, interactive editions in which readers can choose which witness readings to display are possible.",

Are there many witnesses, few, or one? Are the sources relatively close copies or not? Will there be a single base text? Or will witnesses be separately transcribed? If a single base text will be used, will it be that of a particular witness, or will the editor attempt to reconstruct an ideal or original text? Will each reading in an apparatus entry record every attestation (a positive apparatus), or merely witnesses that deviate from the base text (a negative apparatus)? Will the readings of most or all witnesses be represented in the apparatus, or only a selection the editor deems relevant? What level of variation will require distinguishing one witness reading from another? For example, will the editor consider an abbreviated word in a witness as agreeing with the base text, or not? Will conjectures (variant readings suggested by an editor) be treated differently than readings found in witnesses? Will there be a need to distinguish different types of variation, for example orthographic vs. morphological or lexical variants?",

Editors of single-source editions may care to note material aspects of the text (such as damage or unclear text). On the other hand, editors attempting to synthesize an ideal or original text from many witnesses may feel little need to represent the material aspects of individual witnesses.

In some cases, the categories may blur: a scholar may produce an edition introducing readings for which he or she is responsible; that edition may itself become a witness in a later critical apparatus.

For example, a span of text may be marked in the transcription of the primary source as a single deletion but it may be desirable to represent just a few words from this source as individual deletions within the context of a critical apparatus drawing together readings from this and several other witnesses. In this case, the tagging of the span of words as one deletion may need to be decomposed into a series of one-word deletions for encoding within the apparatus.

In order to ensure uniformity, the method generally employed in the library world has been to accept the form found in some authority file, for example that of the American Library of Congress, as the base or neutral form. Feelings can run high on this matter, however, and people are often reluctant to accept as neutral an overtly foreign form of the name of their local saint or hero. Within the person element any number of variant forms of a name can be given, with no prioritization, and hence less likelihood of offence. The Icelandic scholar and manuscript collector Árni Magnússon, to give his name in standard modern Icelandic spelling, is known in Danish as Arne Magnusson, the form which he himself, as a long term resident of Denmark, generally used; there is also a Latinized form, Arnas Magnæus, which he used in his scholarly writings.

A relationship may be mutual, in that all the participants engage in it on an equal footing (for example the sibling relationship); or it may not be if participants are not identical with respect to their role in the relationship (for example, the employer relationship). For non-mutual relationships, only two kinds of role are currently supported; they are named active and passive. These names are chosen to reflect the fact that non-mutual relations are directed, in the sense that they are most readily described by a transitive verb, or a verb phrase of the form is X of or is X to. The subject of the verb is classed as active; the direct object of the verb, or the object of the concluding preposition, as passive. Thus parents are active and children passive in the relationship parent (interpreted as is parent of); the employer is active, the employee passive, in the relationship employs.

Rather than attempting the task of proposing a single taxonomy of text-types (or the equally impossible one of enumerating all those which have been proposed previously), the closed set of situational parameters described above can be used in combination to supply useful distinguishing descriptive features of individual texts, without insisting on a system of discrete high-level text-types.

This approach has the following analytical advantages:Schemes similar to that proposed here were developed in the 1960s and 1970s by researchers such as Hymes, Halliday, and Crystal and Davy, but have rarely been implemented; one notable exception being the pioneering work on the Helsinki Diachronic Corpus of English, on which see #CC-BIBL-1 () it enables a relatively continuous characterization of texts (in contrast to discrete categories based on type or topic) it enables meaningful comparisons across corpora it allows analysts to build and compare their own text-types based on the particular parameters of interest to them it is equally applicable to spoken, written, or signed texts",

So far, we have discussed only ways of pointing at components of the XML information set node such as elements and attributes. However, there is often a need in text analysis to address additional types of location such as the point locations between nodes, and sequences that may arbitrarily cross the boundaries of nodes in a document. The content of an XML document is organized sequentially as well as hierarchically, and it makes sense to consider ranges of characters within a document independently of the nodes to which they belong. From the perspective of most of the pointer schemes discussed below, a TEI document is a tree structure superimposed upon a character stream. Nodes are entities available only in the tree, while points are available only in the stream. For this reason, the schemes below that rely upon character positions (string-index(), string-range(), and match()) cannot take nodes into account. Conversely, XPath (disregarding functions that return atomic values) is a method for locating nodes in the tree and treats those nodes as indivisible units, meaning it is unable to address parts of nodes in their document context.",

It represents a single item in the XML information set for a document. For pointing purposes, the only nodes that are of interest are Text Nodes, Element Nodes, and Attribute Nodes. Sequence A Sequence follows the definition in the XPath 3.1 Data Model, with one alteration. A Sequence is an ordered collection of zero or more items, where an item is either a node or a partial text node. Text Stream A Text Stream is the concatenation of the text nodes in a document and behaves as though all tags had been removed. A text stream begins at a reference node and encompasses all of the text inside that node (if any) and all the text following it in document order. In XPath terms, this would encompass all of the text nodes beginning at a particular node, and following it on the following axis. Point A Point represents a dimensionless point between nodes or characters in a document. Every point is adjacent to either characters or elements, and never to another point. Points can only be referenced in relation to an element or text node in the document (i.e. something addressable by either an XPath or a fragment identifier). Points occur either immediately before or after an element, or at a numbered position inside a text stream. Position zero in the stream would be immediately before the first character. Note that points within attribute values cannot mark the beginning or end of a range extending beyond the attribute value, because points indicate a position within a document. Since attribute nodes are by definition un-ordered, they cannot be said to have a fixed position.",

For each nested citeStructure, if the input reference string contains the value of the delim, then split the string on the value of the delim attribute. If the input string does not contain delim, then stop. Take the portion of the input string after the value of delim and use it as the input string for the child citeStructure. After processing the outer citeStructure, the output will be ('Matt 5:7'), after the second, ('Matt', '5:7'). The end result will be a sequence like ('Matt','5','7'). For each item in the resulting sequence, resolve the matching node by evaluating the XPath in match with the predicate found in use, using the context of the previously matched node, if any. Start with the outer citeStructure and move to the next child citeStructure for each step in the sequence. For example, for the first citeStructure, we could construct an XPath \/\/div[@n='Matt']. The full XPath after the reference Matt 5:7 is resolved will be \/\/div[@n='Matt']\/div[@n='5']\/div[@n='7']. One advantage citeStructure has is that it can be used to generate canonical references, using the declared citation structure to query the text structure.

Although XInclude only requires support for the element() scheme of XPointer, these Guidelines permit the use of any of the pointing schemes discussed in section #SAXP (Pointing Mechanisms) .",

XInclude processing as defined by the W3C is internalization of one or more source documents' content into a stand-off document. TEI use of XInclude for stand-off markup enables use of XInclude-conformant software to perform this useful operation. However, internalization is not clearly defined for all stand-off files, because the structure of the internal and external markup trees may overlap. In particular, when an external markup document selects a range that overlaps partial elements in the source document, it is not clear how the semantics of internalization (inclusion) should work, since partial elements are not XML objects.This corresponds to the observation that overlapping XML tags reflecting a textual version of such an inclusion would not even be well-formed XML. This kind of overlap in textual phenomena of interest is in fact the major reason that stand-off markup is needed. XInclude defines a semantics for this case that involves only complete elements.",

The effect of this is that elements that straddle the start or end of a selected range will be included as wrappers for those of their children that are completely or partially selected by the range. For example, given the following source document: home, home on Brokeback Mountain. That was the song that I sang and the following external document: <body> <div><include href=\"example1.xml\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XInclude\" xpointer=\"range(xpath(id('par1')\/\/emph),xpath(id('par2')\/\/emph))\"\/> <\/div> <\/body> the resulting document after XInclude processing of this external document would be: <body> <div> <p xml:id=\"par1\">home, <emph>home<\/emph> on Brokeback Mountain.<\/p> <p xml:id=\"par2\">That was the <emph>song<\/emph> that I sang<\/p> <\/div> <\/body> The result of the inclusion is two paragraph elements, while the original range designated in the source document overlapped two paragraph fragments. The semantics of XInclude require the creation of well-formed XML results even though the pointing mechanisms it uses do not necessarily respect the hierarchical structure of XML documents, as in this case. While this is a good way to ensure that internalization is always possible, it has implications for the use of XInclude as a notation for the description of overlapping markup structures.",

This sort of structure corresponds to common practice in work with linguistic text corpora. In such corpora, each potentially overlapping hierarchy of elements for the text is represented as a separate stream of stand-off markup. Generally the source text contains markup for the smallest significant units of analysis in the corpus, such as words or morphemes, this information and its markup representing a layer of common information that is shared by all the various hierarchies. As a way of organizing the representation of complex data, this technique generally allows a large number of xml:id attributes to be attached to the shared elements, providing robust anchors for links and facilitating adjustments to the source document without breaking external documents that reference it.",

And when he came home, Borghild asked him to go away, but Sigmund offered her weregild, and she was obliged to accept it. At the funeral feast Borghild was serving beer. She took poison, a big drinking horn full, and brought it to Sinfiotli. When Sinfiotli looked into the horn, he saw that poison was in it, and said to Sigmund This drink is cloudy, old man. Sigmund took the horn and drank it off. It is said that Sigmund was hardy and that poison did him no harm, inside or out. And all his sons could tolerate poison on their skin. Borghild brought another horn to Sinfiotli, and asked him to drink, and everything happened as before. And a third time she brought him a horn, and reproachful words as well, if he didn't drink from it. He spoke again to Sigmund as before. He said Filter it through your mustache, son! Sinfiotli drank it off and at once fell dead. Sigmund carried him a long way in his arms and came to a long, narrow fjord, and there was a small boat there and a man in it. He offered to ferry Sigmund over the fjord. But when Sigmund carried the body out to the boat, it was fully laden. The man said Sigmund should go around the fjord inland. The man pushed the boat out and then suddenly vanished. King Sigmund lived a long time in Denmark in the kingdom of Borghild, after he married her. Then he went south to Frankish lands, to the kingdom he had there. Then he married Hiordis, the daughter of King Eylimi. Their son was Sigurd. King Sigmund fell in a battle with the sons of Hunding. And then Hiordis married Alf, the son of King Hialprec. Sigurd grew up there as a boy. Sigmund and all his sons were tall and outstanding in their strength, their growth, their intelligence, and their accomplishments. But Sigurd was the most outstanding of all, and everyone who knows about the old days says he was the most outstanding of men and the noblest of all the warrior kings.",

This has clear advantages for automatic processing but, on the other hand, this form of data encapsulation also imposes restrictions on the extent of information that can be encoded, essentially limiting it to a single tokenization and lemmatization schema, a single tagset, and a subset of the possible analyses (out from potentially many guesses at the part-of-speech or morphosyntactic descriptions, single values have to fit into the existing attributes). Another important principle that this kind of annotation is sensitive to is the need for (near) homomorphism between the assumed tokenization (division of the text stream into minimal units) and the division into minimal syntactic units (word forms, in the terminology of ISO Morpho-Syntactic Framework, ISO 24611All definitions contained within ISO standards can be accessed at the ISO Online Browsing Platform. For ISO MAF, see https:\/\/www.iso.org\/obp\/ui#iso:std:iso:24611:ed-1:v1:en () .), because it is the former that results from the process of tokenization, but the latter that can be lemmatized and meaningfully described by means of grammatical features. Where tokens are only minimally mismatched with word forms, various repair strategies can be used (e.g., recursing w to capture multi-token compounds or using att.fragmentable to point at disjoint tokens). Beyond that, more robust TEI mechanisms, based on standoff principles and feature structures, should replace lightweight annotation.",

For the former contrast, the part-of-speech (pos) attribute should be used, whereas the latter may use pos and\/or msd attributes, depending on the annotation vocabulary adopted for the project in question. The various grammatical realizations of a single dictionary word can be captured by means of the attribute lemma, which provides a common label for them. For example, English verbs are typically lemmatized as the base form (also called bare infinitive), so the value of lemma for the verbal forms write, writes, wrote, written, and writing is typically write.",

It comes therefore as no surprise that numerous alternative (and often conflicting) lemmatization strategies and tagsets exist, in use by various communities and various tools, and that they change with time (a case in point is the CLAWS tagset for English, with several versions that merge the part-of-speech and morphosyntactic information to various degrees). Given that the English language has relatively poor inflectional morphology, the decision to merge part-of-speech symbols with morphosyntactic features (as in, e.g., CLAWS-7, where the value PPHO1 signals the 3rd person singular objective personal pronoun) is fully justified as the most economical approach. For languages with more robust inflection, the pos and msd attributes will either be used separately, or the part-of-speech information will be merged into the morphosyntactic description. The nature and description of these systems is outside the scope of these Guidelines, but it has to be stressed that all the strategies adopted for linguistic annotation, even at the lightweight level of complexity, must be documented in the header of the given electronic resource, not only for the purpose of guaranteeing successful data interpretation and exchange, but also for the sake of sustainability of the results of the given project.",

Section #FSSY (Other Atomic Feature Values) introduces elements for representing other kinds of atomic feature values such as symbolic, numeric, and string values. Section #FSFL (Feature Libraries and Feature-Value Libraries) introduces the notion of predefined libraries or groups of features or feature values along with methods for referencing their components. Section #FSST (Feature Structures as Complex Feature Values) introduces complex values, in particular feature-structures as values, thus enabling feature structures to be recursively defined. Section #FSSS (Collections as Complex Feature Values) discusses other complex values, in particular values which are collections, organized as sets, bags, and lists. Section #FVE (Feature Value Expressions) discusses how the operations of alternation, negation, and collection of feature values may be represented. Section #FSBO (Default Values) discusses ways of representing underspecified, default, or uncertain values. Section #FSLINK (Linking Text and Analysis) discusses how analyses may be linked to other parts of an encoded text. Section #FD (Feature System Declaration) describes the feature system declaration, a construct which provides for the validation of typed feature structures.

First, if the total number of legal combinations is relatively small, one can predefine all of them in a construct known as a feature library, and then reference the combination required using the feats attribute in the enclosing fs element, rather than give it explicitly. This method is suitable in the situation described above, since it requires specifying a total of only ten (5 + 3 + 2) combinations of features and values. Similarly, to ensure that only feature structures containing valid combinations of feature values are used, one can put definitions for all valid feature structures inside a feature value library (so called, since a feature structure may be the value of a feature).

There is a great deal of disagreement as to what, if any, model-theoretic interpretation feature structures have in such applications, but the status of this formal kind of interpretation is not germane to the present document.

These can be described using the elements defined in the module for figures and graphics; see chapter #FT (Tables, Formulæ, Graphics, and Notated Music) .",

A rooted tree is a directed graph based on a tree; that is, the arcs in the graph correspond to the arcs of a tree such that there is exactly one node, called the root, for which there is a path from that node to all other nodes in the graph. For our purposes, we may ignore all trees except for rooted trees, and hence we shall use the tree element for rooted trees, and the root element for its root. The nodes adjacent to a given node are called its children, and the node adjacent from a given node is called its parent. Nodes with both a parent and children are called internal nodes, for which we use the iNode element. A node with no children is tagged as a leaf. If the children of a node are ordered from left to right, then we say that that node is ordered. If all the nodes of a tree are ordered, then we say that the tree is an ordered tree. If some of the nodes of a tree are ordered and others are not, then the tree is a partially ordered tree. The ordering of nodes and trees may be specified by an attribute; we take the default ordering for trees to be ordered, that roots inherit their ordering from the trees in which they occur, and internal nodes inherit their ordering from their parents. Finally, we permit a node to be specified as following other nodes, which (when its parent is ordered) it would be assumed to precede, giving rise to crossing arcs. The elements used for the encoding of trees have the following descriptions and attributes.",

Whereas in a tree the relationship among the parts is indicated by the children attribute, and by the names of the elements root, iNode, and leaf, the relationship among the parts of an eTree is indicated simply by the arrangement of their content. However, we have chosen to enable encoders to distinguish the terminal elements of an eTree by means of the empty eLeaf element, though its use is not required; the eTree element can also be used to identify the terminal nodes of eTree elements. We also provide a triangle element, which can be thought of as an underspecified eTree, i.e. an eTree in which certain information has been left out. In addition, we provide a forest element, which consists of one or more tree, eTree, or triangle elements, and a listForest element, which consists of one or more forest elements.

These two texts can be analysed in various ways. The first, which we might describe as the Metrical View, encodes the text according to its metrical features: line divisions (as here), stanzas or cantos in larger poems, and perhaps prosodic features like stress or syllable patterns, alliteration, or rhyme. A second view, which we might describe as the Grammatical, encodes linguistic and rhetorical features: phonemes, morphemes, words, phrases, clauses, and sentences. A third view, the Dialogic, might concentrate on narrative voice: distinguishing between the narrator and their interlocutors and identifying individual segments as direct quotations. In our examples, we will restrict ourselves to relatively simple conflicts: for the Metrical View we will encode only metrical lines and line groups; for the Grammatical View we will restrict ourselves to encoding sentences; and for the Dialogic View, we only will distinguish direct quotation from other narration.",

Many (though not all) of the semantic recommendations are provided solely as informal descriptive prose, though some of them are also enforced by means of such constructs as datatypes (see #DTYPES (Datatype Specifications) ), or by schema constraints expressed using the Schematron language. Schematron constraints provide information about special kinds of validation errors dependent on conditional relationships, such as the invalidity of an attribute name or value on one element when another is present, or when, given a pair of attributes such as minOccurs and maxOccurs, the minimum value exceeds the maximum value. Schematron constraints also provide warnings when a particular element, attribute, or combination is to be deprecated in future releases of the TEI scheme, to alert users that the feature in question is no longer to be used after a certain date. Very rarely, TEI Schematron constraints offer warnings that do not explicitly break with the TEI but suggest a more efficient or less ambiguous encoding.

On the other hand, for many applications, it may be desirable to constrain the possible values for the type attribute to a small set of possibilities.

The mechanisms used to instantiate a TEI schema differ for different schema languages, and are therefore not defined here. In XML DTDs, for example, extensive use is made of parameter entities, while in RELAX NG schemas, extensive use is made of patterns. In either case, the names of elements and, wherever possible, their attributes and content models are defined indirectly.

The TEI customization mechanisms allow the user to control this behaviour as follows: particular elements may be suppressed, removing them from any classes in which they are members, and also from any generated schema; new elements may be added to an existing class, thus making them available in macros or content models defined in terms of those classes; additional attributes, or attribute values, may be specified for an individual element or for classes of elements; within certain limits, attributes, or attribute values, may also be removed either from an individual element or for classes of elements; the characteristics inherited by one class from another class may be modified by modifying its class membership: all members of the class then inherit the changed characteristics; the set of values legal for an attribute or attribute class may be constrained or relaxed by supplying or modifying a value list, or by modifying its datatype. within certain limits, the name (generic identifier) associated with an element may be changed, without changing the semantic or syntactic properties of the element; The modification mechanisms presented in this section are quite general, and may be used to make all the types of changes just listed.",
