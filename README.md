# digitai
an interactive AI system developed to equip a small, localized AI model with access to XML resources through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) resource to be queried with XML-aware tools (XPath, XQuery, XSLT). Agentic access to XML-aware queries to be developed with the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
