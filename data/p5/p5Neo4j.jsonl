In particular, they specify a set of markers (or tags) which may be inserted in the electronic representation of the text, in order to mark the text structure and other features of interest. Many, or most, computer programs depend on the presence of such explicit markers for their functionality, since without them a digitized text appears to be nothing but a sequence of undifferentiated bits. The success of the World Wide Web, for example, is partly a consequence of its use of such markup to indicate such features as headings and lists on individual pages, and to indicate links between pages. The process of inserting such explicit markers for implicit textual features is often called markup, or equivalently within this work encoding; the term tagging is also used informally. We use the term encoding scheme or markup language to denote the complete set of rules associated with the use of markup in a given context; we use the term markup vocabulary for the specific set of markers or named distinctions employed by a given encoding scheme.

Examples include wavy underlining to indicate boldface, special symbols for passages to be omitted or printed in a particular font, and so forth.

Encoding a text for computer processing is, in principle, like transcribing a manuscript from scriptio continuaIn the continuous writing characteristic of manuscripts from the early classical period, words are written continuously with no intervening spaces or punctuation.; it is a process of making explicit what is conjectural or implicit, a process of directing the user as to how the content of the text should be (or has been) interpreted.", "labels": ["Paragraph"]}

The set is known as the TEI header, tagged teiHeader, and has five major parts: a file description, tagged fileDesc, containing a full bibliographical description of the computer file itself, from which a user of the text could derive a proper bibliographic citation, or which a librarian or archivist could use in creating a catalogue entry recording its presence within a library or archive. The term computer file here is to be understood as referring to the whole entity or document described by the header, even when this is stored in several distinct operating system files. The file description also includes information about the source or sources from which the electronic document was derived. The TEI elements used to encode the file description are described in section #HD2 (The File Description) below. an encoding description, tagged encodingDesc, which describes the relationship between an electronic text and its source or sources. It allows for detailed description of whether (or how) the text was normalized during transcription, how the encoder resolved ambiguities in the source, what levels of encoding or analysis were applied, and similar matters. The TEI elements used to encode the encoding description are described in section #HD5 (The Encoding Description) below. a text profile, tagged profileDesc, containing classificatory and contextual information about the text, such as its subject matter, the situation in which it was produced, the individuals described by or participating in producing it, and so forth. Such a text profile is of particular use in highly structured composite texts such as corpora or language collections, where it is often highly desirable to enforce a controlled descriptive vocabulary or to perform retrievals from a body of text in terms of text type or origin. The text profile may however be of use in any form of automatic text processing. The TEI elements used to encode the profile description are described in section #HD4 (The Profile Description) below. a container element, tagged xenoData, which allows easy inclusion of metadata from non-TEI schemes (i.e., other than elements in the TEI namespace). For example, the MARC record for the encoded document might be included using MARCXML or MODS. A simple set of metadata for harvesting might be included encoded in Dublin Core. a revision history, tagged revisionDesc, which allows the encoder to provide a history of changes made during the development of the electronic text. The revision history is important for version control and for resolving questions about the history of a file.

As with all elements in the TEI scheme (except egXML) this element is in the TEI namespace (see #SGname (Namespaces) ). Thus, when it is used as the outermost element of a TEI document, it is necessary to specify the TEI namespace on it. This is customarily achieved by including http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 as the value of the XML namespace declaration (xmlns), without indicating a prefix, and then not using a prefix on TEI elements in the rest of the document. For example: TEI version=\"4.8.1\" xml:lang=\"it\" xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\". Como todos los elementos en el esquema TEI (excepto egXML), este elemento se encuentra en el espacio de nombres (namespace) de TEI (cf. #SGname (Namespaces) ). Por lo tanto, cuando se utiliza como el elemento m\u00e1s externo de un documento TEI, es necesario especificar el espacio de nombres de TEI en su interior.

La versi\u00f3n del esquema TEI La versione dello schema TEI gibt die Versionsnummer der TEI-Richtlinien an, gegen die dieses Dokument validiert wird. Major editions of the Guidelines have long been informally referred to by a name made up of the letter P (for Proposal) followed by a digit. The current release is one of the many releases of the fifth major edition of the Guidelines, known as P5. This attribute may be used to associate a TEI document with a specific release of the P5 Guidelines, in the absence of a more precise association provided by the source attribute on the associated schemaSpec. Hauptausgaben der TEI-Richtlinien werden seit langem informell mit einem Namen bezeichnet, der sich aus dem Buchstaben P (f\u00fcr proposal) und einer Ziffer zusammensetzt. Die aktuelle Ausgabe ist eine der vielen Ausgaben der f\u00fcnften Hauptausgabe der Richtlinien, bekannt als P5. Dieses Attribut kann dazu verwendet werden, um ein TEI-Dokument einer bestimmten Version der P5-Richtlinien zuzuordnen, sofern keine genauere Zuordnung durch das Attribut source im assoziierten schemaSpec-Element angegeben ist. Should contain one teiHeader for the corpus, and a series of TEI elements, one for each text. As with all elements in the TEI scheme (except egXML) this element is in the TEI namespace (see #SGname (Namespaces) ). Thus, when it is used as the outermost element of a TEI document, it is necessary to specify the TEI namespace on it. This is customarily achieved by including http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 as the value of the XML namespace declaration (xmlns), without indicating a prefix, and then not using a prefix on TEI elements in the rest of the document. For example: teiCorpus version=\"4.8.1\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\". Este elemento debe contener un teiHeader para el corpus y una serie de elementos TEI para cada texto. Como todos los elementos en el esquema TEI (excepto egXML), este elemento se encuentra en el espacio de nombres (namespace) de TEI (cf. #SGname (Namespaces) ). Por lo tanto, cuando se utiliza como el elemento m\u00e1s externo en un documento TEI, es necesario especificar el espacio de nombres de TEI en su interior. Esto se hace, normalmente, incluyendo http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 como valor de la declaraci\u00f3n del espacio de nombres (xmlns) sin indicar un prefijo, y por lo tanto sin necesidad de utilizar un prefijo en los elementos TEI del resto del documento.

It is clear, however, that strong and consistent structural principles do govern the vast majority of conventional dictionaries, as well as many or most entries even in more exotic dictionaries; encoding guidelines should include these structural principles. We therefore define two distinct elements for dictionary entries, one (entry) which captures the regularities of many conventional dictionary entries, and a second (entryFree) which uses the same elements, but allows them to combine much more freely. It is however recommended that entry be used in preference to entryFree wherever possible.

Since both of these views of the dictionary may be of interest, it proves necessary to develop methods of recording both, and of recording the interrelationship between them as well. Users interested mainly in the printed format of the dictionary will require an encoding to be faithful to an original printed version. However, other users will be interested primarily in capturing the lexical information in a dictionary in a form suitable for further processing, which may demand the expansion or rearrangement of the information contained in the printed form. Further, some users wish to encode both of these views of the data, and retain the links between related elements of the two encodings.

Clearly, however, if we wish to exchange our poems with others, or to include poems others have marked up in our anthology, we will need to know a bit more about the names used for the tags. The means that XML provides for this is called a namespace. In our simple example, the tags just contain a simple name. As we shall see, it is also possible to use tags that include a qualified name, that is, a name with an optional prefix identifying the set of names to which it belongs. For example, we have defined an element line for the purpose of marking lines of verse. Another person might, however, define an element called line for the purpose of marking typographic lines, or drawn lines. Because of these different meanings, if we wish to share data it will be necessary to distinguish the two line components in our marked-up texts. This is achieved by including a namespace prefix within the markup, for example like this: <my:line>This is one of my lines</my:line> <!-- ... --> <yr:line>This is one of your lines</yr:line> This feature is particularly important if we have different definitions of what a line is, of course, but there are many occasions when it is useful to distinguish groups of tags belonging to different markup vocabularies; we discuss this further below (#SGname (Namespaces) ).

It might well be useful if, in the process of preparing our digital anthology, a computer system could check some basic rules about how stanzas, lines, and headings can sensibly co-occur in a document. It would be even more useful if the system could check that stanzas are always tagged stanza and not occasionally canto or Stanza. An XML document in which such rules have been checked is technically known as a valid document, and the ability to perform such validation is one of the key advantages of using XML.

If we want to print a character from the Latin script, besides the selection of the overall glyph shape, this process also requires that a specific weight and size of the font has been selected, and to what degree the shape should be slanted.

In this chapter's descriptions of element content, the phrase prose description should be understood to imply a series of paragraphs, each marked as a p element. The word phrase, by contrast, should be understood to imply character data, interspersed as need be with phrase-level elements, but not organized into paragraphs. For more information on paragraphs, highlighted phrases, lists, etc., see section #COPA (Paragraphs) . grouping elements Elements whose names end with the suffix Stmt (e.g. editionStmt, titleStmt) and the xenoData element enclose a group of specialized elements recording some structured information. In the case of the bibliographic elements, the suffix Stmt is used in names of elements corresponding to the areas of the International Standard Bibliographic Description. For more information on this highly influential family of standards, first proposed in 1969 by the International Federation of Library Associations, see http://www.ifla.org/VII/s13/pubs/isbd.htm () . On the relation between the TEI proposals and other standards for bibliographic description, see further section #HD8 (Note for Library Cataloguers) . In the case of the xenoData element, the specialized elements are not TEI elements, but rather come from some other metadata scheme. In most cases grouping elements may contain prose descriptions as an alternative to the set of specialized elements, thus allowing the encoder to choose whether or not the information concerned should be presented in a structured form or in prose. declarations Elements whose names end with the suffix Decl (e.g. tagsDecl, refsDecl) enclose information about specific encoding practices applied in the electronic text; often these practices are described in coded form. Typically, such information takes the form of a series of declarations, identifying a code with some more complex structure or description. A declaration which applies to more than one text or division of a text need not be repeated in the header of each such text or subdivision. Instead, the decls attribute of each text (or subdivision of the text) to which the declaration applies may be used to supply a cross-reference to it, as further described in section #CCAS (Associating Contextual Information with a Text) . descriptions Elements whose names end with the suffix Desc (e.g. settingDesc, projectDesc) contain a prose description, possibly, but not necessarily, organized under some specific headings by suggested sub-elements.", "labels": ["Paragraph"]}

Are they identified with the element pc, or implied by markup? If retained, how are they placed with respect to related elements? For example, do commas and periods appear inside or outside elements marking phrases and sentences? quotation How were quotation marks processed? Are apostrophes and quotation marks distinguished? How? Are quotation marks retained as content in the text or replaced by markup? Are there any special conventions regarding for example the use of single or double quotation marks when nested? Is the file consistent in its practice or has this not been checked?

See section #COPU-2 (Hyphenation) for discussion of ways in which hyphenation may be encoded. segmentation How is the text segmented? If s or seg segmentation units have been used to divide up the text for analysis, how are they marked and how was the segmentation arrived at? stdVals In most cases, attributes bearing standardized values (such as the when or when-iso attribute on dates) should conform to a defined W3C or ISO datatype.

These generally do not concern the text encoder, since they belong to the domain of formatting and will generally be handled by the rendition software in use. In this section, we discuss issues arising from the appearance of hyphens in pre-existing formatted texts which are being re-encoded for analysis or other processing. Unicode distinguishes four characters visually similar to the hyphen, including the undifferentiated hyphen-minus (U+002D) which is retained for compatibility reasons. The hard hyphen (U+2010) is distinguished from the minus sign (U+2212) which is for use in mathematical expressions, and also from the soft hyphen (U+00AD) which may appear in born digital documents to indicate places where it is acceptable to insert a hyphen when the document is formatted.", "labels": ["Paragraph"]}

In many languages, it is used between words to show that they function as a single syntactic or lexical unit. For example, in French, est-ce que; in English body-snatcher, tea-party etc. It may also have an important role in disambiguation (for example, by distinguishing say a man-eating fish from a man eating fish). Such usages, although possibly problematic when a linguistic analysis is undertaken, are not generally of concern to text encoders: the hyphen character is usually retained in the text, because it may be regarded as part of the way a compound or other lexical item is spelled. Deciding whether a compound is to be decomposed into its constituent parts, and if so how, is a different question, involving consideration of many other phenomena in addition to the simple presence of a hyphen.", "labels": ["Paragraph"]}

The hyphen character is not, in this case, part of the word, but just a signal that the word continues over the break. Unfortunately, few languages distinguish these two cases visually, which necessarily poses a problem for text encoders. Suppose, for example, that we wish to investigate a diachronic English corpus for occurrences of tea-pot and teapot, to find evidence for the point at which this compound becomes lexicalized.

This will obviously apply also if line endings are themselves regarded as unimportant. Alternatively, they may decide to record the presence of the hyphen, perhaps on the grounds that it provides useful morphological information; perhaps in order to retain information about the visual appearance of the original source. In either case, they need to decide whether to record it explicitly, by including an appropriate punctuation character in the text data, or implicitly by supplying an appropriate symbolic value for one or more of the attributes on the lb or other milestone element used to record the fact of the line division. If the hyphen is included in the character data of the TEI document, it might be marked up using the pc (punctuation character) tag, which allows the encoder to express information about its function as a separator, through the force attribute. For example, the example above could be encoded with a force value of \"inter\" to indicate that the punctuation mark may or may not be a word separator (See also #AIPC (Below the Word Level) ). tea-pot A similar range of possibilities applies equally to the representation of other common punctuation marks, notably quotation marks, as discussed in #COHQQ (Quotation) .", "labels": ["Paragraph"]}

If token boundaries are not explicitly marked (for example using the seg or w elements), for most languages a processor will rely on character class information to determine where they are to be found: some punctuation characters are considered to be word-breaking, while others are not. In XML, the newline character in text data is a kind of whitespace, and is therefore word breaking.

On the other hand, in a collection of many works it may prove difficult or impossible to ensure that the same numbered division always corresponds with the same type of textual feature: a chapter may be at level 1 in one work and level 3 in another.", "labels": ["Paragraph"]}

The King graciously pardoned the Knight; Richard was kindly receiv'd into his Convent, and all things went on in good order: But from hence came the Proverb, We must not strike Robert for Richard.

This has obvious advantages of simplicity, but the disadvantage that any deviation from metrical convention is not marked at its precise point of occurrence in the text. Greater precision may be achieved, but only at the cost of marking deviant metrical units explicitly. This may be done with the seg element, giving the variant realization as the value of the real attribute on that element. Using this method, the example given immediately above might be encoded as follows: A needless alexandrine ends the song, That, like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along. The marking of the foot boundaries with the symbol | in the met attribute value of the l element allows the human reader, or a sufficiently intelligent software program, to isolate the correct portion of that attribute value as the default value for the same attribute on the seg elements for feet, namely -+. It is of course up to the encoder to decide whether or not to include the n attribute of seg here, and whether or not also to tag the feet in the line in which there is no deviation from the metrical convention. The ability of software to infer which foot is being marked, if not all are tagged, will depend heavily on the language of the text and the knowledge of prosody built into the software; the fuller and more explicit the markup, the easier it will be for software to handle it. It may prove useful, however, to mark metrical deviations in the manner shown, even if the available software is not sufficiently intelligent to scan lines without aid from the markup.

The teiHeader of the corpus (i.e., the teiHeader that is a child of the outermost TEI or teiCorpus) will contain metadata in its sourceDesc about the CMC platform(s).

The posts of the document will often map directly to the set of posts grouped on an existing web page, thread, or document within a CMC environment. Within the CMC environment the document as such is often created by a particular user, thereby initiating the communication which other users may read, and to which some other users might contribute. This level will naturally be represented by the TEI element. The teiCorpus (or TEI) element that represents the corpus will contain one or more TEI elements as usual. In the teiHeader of a document level TEI, the sourceDesc will contain metadata about the CMC document such as a title, its author or owner, its URL, the date of its creation, the date of the last change made to it, and other metadata that are available and to be recorded such as one or more categories associated with the document. The document sometimes contains, or is associated with, a prompt such as a video or a news item, either provided by the initiating user herself or located elsewhere and referenced at the beginning of the document. In such cases, the teiHeader of the document should also contain metadata about this prompt.

Mask of Tutankhamun 256a 60672 220 Museum of Egyptian Antiquities 15 Meret Basha Ismailia Cairo Egypt 30.047778 31.233333 The back and shoulders of the mask is inscribed with a protective spell in Egyptian hieroglyphs formed of ten vertical and horizontal lines. This spell first appeared on masks in the Middle Kingdom at least 500 years before Tutankhamun, and comes from chapter 151 of the Book of the Dead. The mask of Tutankhamun is 54cm x 39.3cm x 49cm. It is constructed from two layers of high-karat gold that varies in thickness from 1.5-3mm. It weighs approximately 10.23kg and x-ray crystallography shows that it is composed of two alloys of gold with a lighter 18.4 karat shade being used for the face and neck while a heavier 22.5 karat gold was used for the rest of the mask. In the mask Tutankhamun wears a nemes headcloth which has the royal insignia of a cobra (Wadjet) and vulture (Nekhbet) on it. These are thought respectively to symbolize Tutankhamun's rule of both Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt. His ears are pierced for earrings. The mask has rich inlays of coloured glass and gemstones, including lapis lazuli surrounding the eye and eyebrows, quartz for the eyes, obsidian for the pupils. The broad collar is made up of carnelian, feldspar, turquoise, amazonite, faience and other stones. The mask of Tutankhamun was created in Egypt around 1323 BC. It is a death mask of the 18th-dynasty ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Tutankhamun who reigned 1332\u20131323 BC. The mask of Tutankhamun was found in his burial chamber at Theban Necropolis in the Valley of the Kings in 1922. On 28 October 1925 the excavation team led by English archaeologist Howard Carter opened the heavy sarcophagus and three coffins and were the first people in around 3,250 years to see the mask of Tutankhamun. Carter wrote in his diary: The pins removed, the lid was raised. The penultimate scene was disclosed \u2013 a very neatly wrapped mummy of the young king, with golden mask of sad but tranquil expression, symbolizing Osiris \u2026 the mask bears that god's attributes, but the likeness is that of Tut.Ankh.Amen \u2013 placid and beautiful, with the same features as we find upon his statues and coffins. The mask has fallen slightly back, thus its gaze is straight up to the heavens. In December 1925, the mask was removed from the tomb, placed in a crate and transported 635 kilometres (395 mi) to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, where it remains on public display. When it was discovered in 1925, the 2.5kg narrow gold beard was no longer attached to the mask and was reattached to the chin by use of a wooden dowel in 1944. In August 2014 when the mask was removed from its display case for cleaning, the beard fell off again. Those working in the museum unadvisedly used a quick-drying epoxy to attempt to fix it, but left the beard off-centre. The damage was noticed and repaired in January 2015 by a German-Egyptian team who used beeswax, a material known to be used as adhesives by the ancient Egyptians.", "labels": ["Paragraph"]}

The jewel was discovered in 1693 at Petherton Park, North Petherton in the English county of Somerset, on land owned by Sir Thomas Wroth. North Petherton is about 8 miles away from Athelney, where King Alfred founded a monastery. A description of the Alfred Jewel was first published in 1698, in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. It was bequeathed to Oxford University by Colonel Nathaniel Palmer (c. 1661-1718) and today is in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.

The base contains two basalt fountains and decorative reliefs inspired by pre-Hispanic art. The library has ten windowless floors for book storage, each having enough space for 120 thousand volumes. These storage areas have the necessary lighting, temperature and humidty conditions for book conservation. In the reading room, flanked by a garden on each side, the diffuse and matte light is filtered through thin tecali stone slabs. The semi-basement of the building contains the service and administrative offices of the library. The building facades are covered with one of the largest murals in the world and is made from naturally colored stone tiles. It is entitled Historical Representation of Culture and is by Juan O'Gorman. Base At the base of the building there are two basalt fountains and decorative reliefs around the outside that are inspired by pre-Hispanic art. The color of the stone in these elements is left exposed to take advantage of the stone's texture as an aesthetic and expressive element, and to give a sense of continuity to the external pavement. Murals The outside windowless portion of the building contains one of the largest murals in the world. This is called Historical Representation of the Culture and is a stone polychromatic mosaic based on the combination of 12 basic colors. The mural is created in an impressionist style where the coloured tiles when seen from a distance form specific figures. The 12 colors where chosen from 150 samples of original stones with the criteria including the stone's resistance to degredation by weather. According to the artist, Juan O'Gorman, in the mosaic he represented three fundamental historical facets of the Mexican culture: the pre-Hispanic era, the Spanish colonial era, and the modern age. For example with the North Wall, this represents the pre-Hispanic era and is dominated by mythical elements relating to the life-death duality. The left side of the main axis there are deities and scenes pertaining to the creation of life. The right hand side of the mural contains figures relating to death. For a more detailed description see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Library_(UNAM)#Murals. In 1948 the architect and artist Juan O'Gorman, in collaboration with architects Gustavo Saavedra and Juan Martinez de Velasco designed the building with a functionalist approach, as part of the greater project of the construction of the University City on the grounds of the Pedregal de San Angel in Mexico City. Originally the building was planned to host the National Library and National Newspaper Library of Mexico. The library finally opened its doors for the first time on 5 April 1956. In July 2007 it was declared a UNESCO world heritage site.

However, internalization is not clearly defined for all stand-off files, because the structure of the internal and external markup trees may overlap. In particular, when an external markup document selects a range that overlaps partial elements in the source document, it is not clear how the semantics of internalization (inclusion) should work, since partial elements are not XML objects.This corresponds to the observation that overlapping XML tags reflecting a textual version of such an inclusion would not even be well-formed XML.

It comes therefore as no surprise that numerous alternative (and often conflicting) lemmatization strategies and tagsets exist, in use by various communities and various tools, and that they change with time (a case in point is the CLAWS tagset for English, with several versions that merge the part-of-speech and morphosyntactic information to various degrees). Given that the English language has relatively poor inflectional morphology, the decision to merge part-of-speech symbols with morphosyntactic features (as in, e.g., CLAWS-7, where the value PPHO1 signals the 3rd person singular objective personal pronoun) is fully justified as the most economical approach. For languages with more robust inflection, the pos and msd attributes will either be used separately, or the part-of-speech information will be merged into the morphosyntactic description.

The bicond element encodes the biconditional (if and only if) operation of boolean logic. It succeeds only when the corresponding if-then conditionals in both directions are true. In feature structure constraints the antecedent and consequent are expressed as feature structures; they are considered true if they subsume (see section #FDFD (Feature Declarations) ) the feature structure in question, but in the case of consequents, this truth is asserted rather than simply tested. That is to say, a conditional is enforced by determining that the antecedent does not (and will never) subsume the given feature structure, or by determining that the antecedent does subsume the given feature structure, and then unifying the consequent with it (the result of which, if successful, will be subsumed by the consequent). In practice, the enforcement of such constraints can result in periods in which the truth of a constraint with respect to a given feature structure is simply not known; in this case, the constraint must be persistently monitored as the feature structure becomes more informative until either its truth value is determined or computation fails for some other reason.", "labels": ["Paragraph"]}

This means, among other things, that the actual repertoire of characters which the standard encodes, especially those parts dating from its earlier days, include a number of items which on a strict interpretation of the Unicode Consortium's theoretical approach should not have been regarded as abstract characters in their own right. Some of these characters are grouped together into a code-point regions assigned to compatibility characters. Ligatures are a case in point. Ligatures (e.g. the joining of adjacent lowercase letters s and t or f and i in Latin scripts, whether produced by a scribal practice of not lifting the pen between strokes or dictated by the aesthetics of a type design) are representational features with no added semantic value beyond that of the two letters they unite (though for historians of typography their presence and form in a given edition may be of scholarly significance). However, by the time the Unicode standard was first being debated, it had become common practice to include single glyphs representing the more common ligatures in the repertoires of some typesetting devices and high-end printers, and for the coded character sets built into those devices to use a single code point for such glyphs, even though they represent two distinct abstract characters. So as to increase the acceptance of Unicode among the makers and users of such devices, it was agreed that some such pseudo-characters should be incorporated into the standard as compatibility characters. Nevertheless, if a project requires the presence of such ligatured forms to be encoded, this should normally be done via markup, not by the use of a compatibility character. That way, the presence of the ligature can still be identified (and, if desired, rendered visually) where appropriate, but indexing and retrieval software will treat the code points in the document as a simple sequential occurrence of the two constituent characters concerned and so correctly align their semantics with non-ligatured equivalents. Such ligatures should not be confused with digraphs (usually) indicating diphthongs, as in the French word \"c\u0153ur\". A digraph is an atomic orthographic unit representing an abstract character in its own right, not purely an amalgamation of glyphs, and indexing and retrieval software will need to treat it as such. Where a digraph occurs in a source text, it should normally be encoded using the appropriate code point for the single abstract character which it represents.", "labels": ["Paragraph"]}

It is obvious enough that it would be feasible to represent many characters with diacritical marks in Latin and some other scripts by a sequence of code points, where one code point designated the base character and the remainder represented one or more diacritical marks that were to be combined with the base character to produce an appropriate glyphic rendering of the abstract character concerned. From its earliest phase, the Unicode Consortium espoused this view in theory but was prepared in practice to compromise by assigning single code points to precomposed characters which were already commonly assigned a single distinctive code point in existing encoding schemes. This means, however, that for quite a large number of commonly-occurring abstract characters, Unicode has two different, but logically and semantically equivalent encodings: a precomposed single code point, and a code point sequence of a base character plus one or more combining diacritics. Scripts more recently added to Unicode no longer exhibit this code-point duplication (in current practice no new precomposed characters are defined where the use of combining characters is possible) but this does nothing to remove the problem caused by the duplications from older character sets that have been permanently embodied in Unicode. Together with essentially analogous issues arising from the encoding of certain East Asian ideographs. This duplication gives rise to the need to practice normalization of Unicode documents. Normalization is the process of ensuring that a given abstract character is represented in one way only in a given Unicode document or document collection. The Unicode Consortium provides four standard normalization forms, of which the Normalization Form C (NFC) seems to be most appropriate for text encoding projects. The NFC, as far as possible, defines conversions for all base characters followed by one or more combining characters into the corresponding precomposed characters. The World Wide Web Consortium has produced a document entitled Character Model for the World Wide Web 1.0Available at https://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/ () ., which among other things discusses normalization issues and outlines some relevant principles.

Text which is only typographically emphasized falls into the class of highlighted text, and may be tagged with the hi element. In printed works, emphasis is generally indicated by devices such as the use of an italic font, a large typeface, or extra wide letter spacing; in manuscripts and typescripts, it is usually indicated by the use of underlining. As the following examples demonstrate, an encoder may choose whether or not to make explicit the particular type of rendition associated with the emphasis. If a source text consistently renders a particular feature (e.g. emphasis or words in foreign languages) in a particular way, the rendering associated with that feature may be described in the TEI header using the rendition element. The rend, rendition, or style attributes may then be used to describe examples which deviate from the norm. For example, assuming that the TEI header has defined a default rendering for the emph element, the following encoding would use it: Sex, sir, is purely a question of appetite! Tarr exclaimed. If on the other hand no such default has been defined for the element, the encoder may specify it informally using the rend attribute: What it all comes to is this, he said. What does Christopher Robin do in the morning nowadays?

Usage labels typically indicate temporal use (archaic, obsolete, etc.) register (slang, formal, taboo, ironic, facetious, etc.) style (literal, figurative, etc.) connotative effect (e.g. derogatory, offensive) subject field (Astronomy, Philosophy, etc.) national or regional use (Australian, U.S., Midland dialect, etc.) Many dictionaries provide an explanation and/or a list of such usage labels in a preface or appendix. The type of the usage information may be indicated in the type attribute on the usg element. Some typical values are: geo geographic area time temporal, historical era (archaic, old, etc.) dom domain reg register style style (figurative, literal, etc.) plev preference level (chiefly, usually, etc.) acc acceptability lang language for foreign words, spellings pronunciations, etc. gram grammatical usage In addition to this kind of information, multilingual dictionaries often provide semantic cues to help the user determine the right sense of a word in the source language (and hence the correct translation). These include synonyms, concept subdivisions, typical subjects and objects, typical verb complements, etc. These labels may also be marked with the usg element; sample values for the type attribute in these cases include: syn synonym given to show use hyper hypernym given to show usage colloc collocation given to show usage comp typical complement obj typical object subj typical subject verb typical verb hint unclassifiable piece of information to guide sense choice", "labels": ["Paragraph"]}

So far, we have discussed only ways of pointing at components of the XML information set node such as elements and attributes. However, there is often a need in text analysis to address additional types of location such as the point locations between nodes, and sequences that may arbitrarily cross the boundaries of nodes in a document. The content of an XML document is organized sequentially as well as hierarchically, and it makes sense to consider ranges of characters within a document independently of the nodes to which they belong. From the perspective of most of the pointer schemes discussed below, a TEI document is a tree structure superimposed upon a character stream. Nodes are entities available only in the tree, while points are available only in the stream. For this reason, the schemes below that rely upon character positions (string-index(), string-range(), and match()) cannot take nodes into account. Conversely, XPath (disregarding functions that return atomic values) is a method for locating nodes in the tree and treats those nodes as indivisible units, meaning it is unable to address parts of nodes in their document context.", "labels": ["Paragraph"]}
{"id": "4:223785fa-2e25-4598-887d-0a5b446743b2:2840", "text": "The TEI pointer scheme thus distinguishes the following kinds of object: Node A node is an instance of one of the node kinds defined in the XQuery and XPath Data Model 3.1. It represents a single item in the XML information set for a document. For pointing purposes, the only nodes that are of interest are Text Nodes, Element Nodes, and Attribute Nodes. Sequence A Sequence follows the definition in the XPath 3.1 Data Model, with one alteration. A Sequence is an ordered collection of zero or more items, where an item is either a node or a partial text node. Text Stream A Text Stream is the concatenation of the text nodes in a document and behaves as though all tags had been removed. A text stream begins at a reference node and encompasses all of the text inside that node (if any) and all the text following it in document order. In XPath terms, this would encompass all of the text nodes beginning at a particular node, and following it on the following axis. Point A Point represents a dimensionless point between nodes or characters in a document. Every point is adjacent to either characters or elements, and never to another point. Points can only be referenced in relation to an element or text node in the document (i.e. something addressable by either an XPath or a fragment identifier). Points occur either immediately before or after an element, or at a numbered position inside a text stream. Position zero in the stream would be immediately before the first character. Note that points within attribute values cannot mark the beginning or end of a range extending beyond the attribute value, because points indicate a position within a document.

After processing the outer citeStructure, the output will be ('Matt 5:7'), after the second, ('Matt', '5:7'). The end result will be a sequence like ('Matt','5','7'). For each item in the resulting sequence, resolve the matching node by evaluating the XPath in match with the predicate found in use, using the context of the previously matched node, if any. Start with the outer citeStructure and move to the next child citeStructure for each step in the sequence. For example, for the first citeStructure, we could construct an XPath //div[@n='Matt']. The full XPath after the reference Matt 5:7 is resolved will be //div[@n='Matt']/div[@n='5']/div[@n='7']. One advantage citeStructure has is that it can be used to generate canonical references, using the declared citation structure to query the text structure.

Similarly, we may indicate that we have more confidence in the persName tagging within those div elements which have a type value of checked: If an element in a document is matched by more than one match expression, then the most specific pattern applies. Specificity of pattern matching is defined further in the XSLT3 reference cited above (see https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/#default-priority () ) As a simple case, if both the preceding certainty elements were present in the same document, a persName occurring within a div type=\"checked\" element would potentially match both pattern expressions.

An implementor may choose, for example, whether to pre-process processing model specifications into a free standing pipeline, or to extract and process them dynamically during document processing. However, although implementors are generally free to interpret the processing model documentation according to their own requirements, some general assumptions underlie the recommendations made here: If a model element has no child param elements, the action specified by its behaviour should be applied to the whole element node concerned, including its child nodes of whatever type. If that behaviour requires distinguishing particular parts of the input, an implementation may choose either to make those distinctions itself, or to raise an error. If a model element has no predicate or output attribute then it is assumed to apply to all instances of the element defined in its parent elementSpec for all outputs. Otherwise its applicability depends on these attributes. Only one of the models is to be applied for a particular instance of the element, except when they appear within a modelSequence A matching model is one where the element to be processed satisfies the XPath in the predicate attribute of the model or modelSequence and the current output method matches the method specified in the output attribute of the model, modelSequence, or a containing modelGrp. A model or modelSequence without a predicate always matches the element to be processed. A model, modelGrp, or modelSequence without an output attribute matches any output method. Processing Model implementations must execute only the first matching model or modelSequence in document order. If there are two or more model elements provided for an elementSpec but they have different output attributes then the implementation should choose the model appropriate to the desired output. If there are two or more model elements provided for an elementSpec but they have different predicate attributes then the implementation should choose the model whose predicate provides the most specific context (where specific is understood in the same way as in XSLT) In the following example, which shows part of the element specification for the head element, there are two model elements, one with and one without a predicate attribute: Model for list headings Default model for all headings.

On the other hand, where a new text is being prepared to an exact specification, for entry into a textual database of some kind for example, the more precisely stated the rules, the better they can be enforced. Even in marking up an existing text, a restrictive set of schema rules may be beneficial, especially when applied to test a particular view or hypothesis about the text. A schema designed for use by a small project or team is likely to take a different position on such issues than one intended for use by a large and possibly fragmented community.

(The first forward slash in the XPath expression indicates the document node.) In XPath, it is also possible to refer to children, grandchildren, and other descendants of the family tree using two forward slashes together.

The TEI header is not a library catalogue record, and so will not make all of the distinctions essential in standard library work. It also includes much information generally excluded from standard bibliographic descriptions. It is the intention of the developers, however, to ensure that the information required for a catalogue record be retrievable from the TEI file header, and moreover that the mapping from the one to the other be as simple and straightforward as possible. Where the correspondence is not obvious, it may prove useful to consult one of the works which were influential in developing the content of the TEI header. These include:ISBD ISBD: International Standard Bibliographic Description is an international standard setting out what information should be recorded in a description of a bibliographical item. Until a consolidated edition published in 2011, there was a general standard called ISBD(G) and separate ISBDs covering different types of material, e.g. ISBD(M) for monographs, ISBD(ER) for electronic resources. These separate ISBDs follow the same general scheme as the main ISBD(G), but provide appropriate interpretations for the specific materials under consideration. AACR2 The Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (second edition) were published in 1978, with revisions appearing periodically through 2005. AACR2 provides guidelines for the construction of catalogues in general libraries in the English-speaking world. AACR2 is explicitly based on the general framework of the ISBD(G) and the subsidiary ISBDs: it gives a description of how to describe bibliographic items and how to create access points such as subject or name headings and uniform titles. Other national cataloguing codes exist as well, including the Z44 series of standards from issued by the Association fran\u00e7aise de normalisation (AFNOR), Regeln f\u00fcr die alphabetische Katalogisierung in wissenschaftlichen Bibliotheken (RAK-WB), Regole italiane di catalogazione per autore (RICA), and \u0421\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438, \u0431\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0443. \u0411\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c. \u0411\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u041e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f (\u0413\u041e\u0421\u0422 7.1).

For the majority of modern languages, writing is arranged as a series of lines which are to be read from top to bottom. Within each line, individual characters are frequently presented from left to right (English, Russian, Greek), but there are also several widely-used scripts which run right-to-left (Arabic, Hebrew). Writing in which the lines of glyphs are presented vertically and read from right to left is also often encountered, notably in East Asian scripts (Sinitic characters, Japanese Kana, Korean Hangul, Vietnamese ch\u1eef n\u00f4m). In many cases, a language normally uses the same writing mode (we use this term to refer to the orientation of individual glyphs within a line and the order in which glyphs and lines should be read), but there are exceptions in which the same language may appear in different modes, for example either vertically or horizontally. Many East Asian scripts were traditionally written from top to bottom within the line, with their lines sequenced from right to left. Although modern Japanese, Chinese, and Korean are often written horizontally, the traditional vertical writing mode is still widely used. There are also comparatively rare cases of ancient scripts written with lines running left to right, each line being read top to bottom (Ancient Uighur, classical Mongolian and Manchu), or scripts such as Ogham where the writing direction may start from the bottom left and run around the edge of an inscribed object.", "labels": ["Paragraph"]}

For example, when Japanese is written horizontally, the Unicode character U+3001, the ideographic comma, is used in preference to Unicode character U+FE11, the vertical mode comma. This ensures that the comma appears in the correct position relative to the surrounding glyphs. Even for scripts which are usually written in exactly the same way, different writing modes may be encountered in particular contexts; for example when a language using Roman script is embedded within vertically-organized Chinese text, it may sometimes be displayed vertically and sometimes horizontally. The writing mode may also vary in response to layout constraints such as those imposed by a complex table, where column or row labels may be written vertically or diagonally to make the most effective use of available space, just as it may vary in response to the size and shape of the carrier in the case of a monumental inscription.", "labels": ["Paragraph"]}

This reflects the special difficulties which apply to the encoding or transcription of speech. Speech varies according to a large number of dimensions, many of which have no counterpart in writing (for example, tempo, loudness, pitch, etc.). The audibility of speech recorded in natural communication situations is often less than perfect, affecting the accuracy of the transcription. Spoken material may be transcribed in the course of linguistic, acoustic, anthropological, psychological, ethnographic, journalistic, or many other types of research. Even in the same field, the interests and theoretical perspectives of different transcribers may lead them to prefer different levels of detail in the transcript and different styles of visual display. The production and comprehension of speech are intimately bound up with the situation in which speech occurs, far more so than is the case for written texts. A speech transcript must therefore include some contextual features; determining which are relevant is not always simple.

Speech itself, though it may be represented as words, frequently contains items such as vocalized pauses which, although only semi-lexical, have immense importance in the analysis of spoken text. Even non-vocal elements such as gestures may be regarded as forming a component of spoken text for some analytic purposes.

Most contemporary post-based CMC technologies provide features for the inclusion of graphic and audio-visual content (emoji graphics, images, videos) into posts and even to produce posts without verbal content (which then may consist only of emojis, an image, or a video file). Written and multimodal posts are the standard formats for user contributions in primarily text-based CMC genres and applications such as chat, SMS, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, X (Twitter), online forums, or Wikipedia talk pages. as audio posts, which are produced using a recording function. In contrast to CMC units of the type utterance which are produced and transmitted simultaneously, audio posts first have to be recorded as a whole and are then transmitted, as audio files, via the internet; the availability of the recording is indicated in the screen protocol by a template-generated, visual post; the recipients can play the recording (repeatedly) by activating the play button displayed in the post on the screen.

We call such a resource a digital facsimile. A digital facsimile may, in the simplest case, just consist of a collection of images, with some metadata to identify them and the source materials portrayed. It may sometimes contain a variety of images of the same source pages, perhaps of different resolutions, or of different kinds. Such a collection may form part of any kind of document, for example a commentary of a codicological or paleographic nature, where there is a need to align explanatory text with image data.

Details of appearance such as column widths, border lines, and alignment are generally encoded by numerous attributes. Beyond this, however, such schemas differ greatly.

This correspondence represents a slightly looser relationship than the one in the preceding example; there is no sense in which an allegorical character could be substituted for the physical city, or vice versa, but there is obviously a correspondence between them. synchronous \ub3d9\uc2dc\ubc1c\uc0dd sincr\u00f3nico synchrone sincrono \u9023\u52d5 synchron points to elements that are synchronous with the current element. \ud604 \uc694\uc18c\uc640 \ub3d9\uc2dc \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uac00\ub9ac\ud0a8\ub2e4. \u9023\u7d50\u5230\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u73fe\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u540c\u6642\u51fa\u73fe\u3002 \u5f53\u8a72\u8981\u7d20\u3068\u9023\u52d5\u3059\u308b\u8981\u7d20\u3092\u793a\u3059\u3002 pointe vers des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui sont synchrones avec l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment en question. se\u00f1ala los elementos que son sincr\u00f3nicos con el elemento corriente. punta a elementi sincroni rispetto all'elemento corrente zeigt auf Elemente, die synchron mit dem aktuellen Element sind. points to an element that is the same as the current element. \ud604 \uc694\uc18c\uc640 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uac00\ub9ac\ud0a8\ub2e4. \u9023\u7d50\u5230\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u73fe\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u76f8\u540c\u3002 \u5f53\u8a72\u8981\u7d20\u3068\u540c\u4e00\u306e\u8981\u7d20\u3092\u793a\u3059\u3002 pointe vers un \u00e9l\u00e9ment identique \u00e0 l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment en question. se\u00f1ala el elementos que se corresponde exactamente con el elemento corriente. punta a un elemento che corrisponde esattamente all'elemento corrente zeigt auf ein Element, das mit dem aktuellen Element identisch ist. points to an element of which the current element is a copy. \ud604 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \uadf8 \ubcf5\uc0ac\uc778 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uac00\ub9ac\ud0a8\ub2e4. \u73fe\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u70ba\u6240\u9023\u7d50\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u8907\u88fd\u672c\u3002 \u5f53\u8a72\u8981\u7d20\u306e\u30b3\u30d4\u30fc\u8981\u7d20\u3092\u793a\u3059\u3002 pointe vers un \u00e9l\u00e9ment dont l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment en question est une copie. se\u00f1ala un elemento del que el elemento corriente es una copia. punta a un elemento di cui l'elemento corrente \u00e8 una copia zeigt auf ein Element, von dem das aktuelle Element eine Kopie ist.

Sigmund took the horn and drank it off. It is said that Sigmund was hardy and that poison did him no harm, inside or out. And all his sons could tolerate poison on their skin. Borghild brought another horn to Sinfiotli, and asked him to drink, and everything happened as before. And a third time she brought him a horn, and reproachful words as well, if he didn't drink from it. He spoke again to Sigmund as before. He said Filter it through your mustache, son! Sinfiotli drank it off and at once fell dead. Sigmund carried him a long way in his arms and came to a long, narrow fjord, and there was a small boat there and a man in it. He offered to ferry Sigmund over the fjord. But when Sigmund carried the body out to the boat, it was fully laden. The man said Sigmund should go around the fjord inland. The man pushed the boat out and then suddenly vanished. King Sigmund lived a long time in Denmark in the kingdom of Borghild, after he married her. Then he went south to Frankish lands, to the kingdom he had there. Then he married Hiordis, the daughter of King Eylimi. Their son was Sigurd. King Sigmund fell in a battle with the sons of Hunding. And then Hiordis married Alf, the son of King Hialprec. Sigurd grew up there as a boy.

In linguistic application, such a system of constraints is the principal means by which the grammar of some natural language is expressed. There is a great deal of disagreement as to what, if any, model-theoretic interpretation feature structures have in such applications, but the status of this formal kind of interpretation is not germane to the present document.

An directed graph is like an undirected graph except that the arcs are ordered pairs of nodes.

That is, it is possible in a tree graph to follow a path from any vertex to any other vertex, but there are no paths that lead from any vertex to itself. A rooted tree is a directed graph based on a tree; that is, the arcs in the graph correspond to the arcs of a tree such that there is exactly one node, called the root, for which there is a path from that node to all other nodes in the graph. For our purposes, we may ignore all trees except for rooted trees, and hence we shall use the tree element for rooted trees, and the root element for its root. The nodes adjacent to a given node are called its children, and the node adjacent from a given node is called its parent. Nodes with both a parent and children are called internal nodes, for which we use the iNode element. A node with no children is tagged as a leaf. If the children of a node are ordered from left to right, then we say that that node is ordered. If all the nodes of a tree are ordered, then we say that the tree is an ordered tree. If some of the nodes of a tree are ordered and others are not, then the tree is a partially ordered tree. The ordering of nodes and trees may be specified by an attribute; we take the default ordering for trees to be ordered, that roots inherit their ordering from the trees in which they occur, and internal nodes inherit their ordering from their parents.

Schematron constraints also provide warnings when a particular element, attribute, or combination is to be deprecated in future releases of the TEI scheme, to alert users that the feature in question is no longer to be used after a certain date.

An ODD processor, such as the Roma application supported by the TEI, or any other comparable set of stylesheets will use the declarations provided by an ODD to generate appropriate sets of declarations in a specific schema language such as RELAX NG or the XML DTD language. We do not discuss in detail here how this should be done, since the details are schema language-specific; some background information about the methods used for XML DTD and RELAX NG schema generation is however provided in section #STIN (Defining a TEI Schema) . Several example ODD files are also provided as part of the standard TEI release: see further section #MDlite (Examples of Modification) below.", "labels": ["Paragraph"]}
