In particular, they specify a set of markers (or tags) which may be inserted in the electronic representation of the text, in order to mark the text structure and other features of interest. Many, or most, computer programs depend on the presence of such explicit markers for their functionality, since without them a digitized text appears to be nothing but a sequence of undifferentiated bits. The success of the World Wide Web, for example, is partly a consequence of its use of such markup to indicate such features as headings and lists on individual pages, and to indicate links between pages. The process of inserting such explicit markers for implicit textual features is often called markup, or equivalently within this work encoding; the term tagging is also used informally. We use the term encoding scheme or markup language to denote the complete set of rules associated with the use of markup in a given context; we use the term markup vocabulary for the specific set of markers or named distinctions employed by a given encoding scheme. Thus, this work both describes the TEI encoding scheme, and documents the TEI markup vocabulary.",

Encoding a text for computer processing is, in principle, like transcribing a manuscript from scriptio continua In the continuous writing characteristic of manuscripts from the early classical period, words are written continuously with no intervening spaces or punctuation.; it is a process of making explicit what is conjectural or implicit, a process of directing the user as to how the content of the text should be (or has been) interpreted.",

This is particularly the case when the rules being defined relate to texts that already exist: the designer may have only the haziest of notions as to an ancient text's original purpose or meaning and hence find it very difficult to specify consistent rules about its structure. On the other hand, where a new text is being prepared to an exact specification, for entry into a textual database of some kind for example, the more precisely stated the rules, the better they can be enforced. Even in marking up an existing text, a restrictive set of schema rules may be beneficial, especially when applied to test a particular view or hypothesis about the text. A schema designed for use by a small project or team is likely to take a different position on such issues than one intended for use by a large and possibly fragmented community. It is important to remember that every schema results from an interpretation of a text. There is no single schema encompassing the absolute truth about any text, although it may be convenient to privilege some schemas above others for particular types of analysis.",

As discussed above, however, the use of simple rules can also greatly simplify the task of tagging accurately elements of less rigidly constrained texts.

In the example above, the word to the left of the equals sign is the pattern's name, and the material following it declares a meaning for the pattern. Patterns may also be of particular types; the ones that interest us here are called element patterns and attribute patterns. In this example we see definitions for five element patterns. Note that we have used similar names for the pattern and the element which the pattern describes: so, for example, the line anthology_p = element anthology {poem_p+} defines an element pattern called anthology_p, the value of which defines an element called anthology. These naming conventions are arbitrary; we could use the same name for the pattern as for the element, but we want to make clear that the two are syntactically quite distinct.

The core module, defined in chapter #CO (Elements Available in All TEI Documents) contains declarations for elements and attributes which are likely to be needed in almost any kind of document, and is therefore recommended for global use. The header module defined in chapter #HD (The TEI Header) provides declarations for the metadata elements and attributes constituting the TEI header, a component which is required for TEI conformance, while the textstructure module defined in chapter #DS (Default Text Structure) declares basic structural elements needed for the encoding of most book-like objects.

The set is known as the TEI header, tagged teiHeader, and has five major parts: a file description, tagged fileDesc, containing a full bibliographical description of the computer file itself, from which a user of the text could derive a proper bibliographic citation, or which a librarian or archivist could use in creating a catalogue entry recording its presence within a library or archive. The term computer file here is to be understood as referring to the whole entity or document described by the header, even when this is stored in several distinct operating system files. The file description also includes information about the source or sources from which the electronic document was derived. The TEI elements used to encode the file description are described in section #HD2 (The File Description) below. an encoding description, tagged encodingDesc, which describes the relationship between an electronic text and its source or sources. It allows for detailed description of whether (or how) the text was normalized during transcription, how the encoder resolved ambiguities in the source, what levels of encoding or analysis were applied, and similar matters. The TEI elements used to encode the encoding description are described in section #HD5 (The Encoding Description) below. a text profile, tagged profileDesc, containing classificatory and contextual information about the text, such as its subject matter, the situation in which it was produced, the individuals described by or participating in producing it, and so forth. Such a text profile is of particular use in highly structured composite texts such as corpora or language collections, where it is often highly desirable to enforce a controlled descriptive vocabulary or to perform retrievals from a body of text in terms of text type or origin. The text profile may however be of use in any form of automatic text processing. The TEI elements used to encode the profile description are described in section #HD4 (The Profile Description) below. a container element, tagged xenoData, which allows easy inclusion of metadata from non-TEI schemes (i.e., other than elements in the TEI namespace). For example, the MARC record for the encoded document might be included using MARCXML or MODS. A simple set of metadata for harvesting might be included encoded in Dublin Core. a revision history, tagged revisionDesc, which allows the encoder to provide a history of changes made during the development of the electronic text. The revision history is important for version control and for resolving questions about the history of a file.

Second, biblFull and fileDesc use the child element publicationStmt to cover not only the publication, production, distribution, etc. area but also the resource identifier and terms of availability area associated with that publication.

In other cases sequences of such elements will be grouped together hierarchically into textual divisions and subdivisions, such as chapters or sections. The names used for these structural subdivisions of texts vary with the genre and period of the text, or even at the whim of the author, editor, or publisher. For example, a major subdivision of an epic or of the Bible is generally called a book, that of a report is usually called a part or section, that of a novel a chapter—unless it is an epistolary novel, in which case it may be called a letter. Even texts which are not organized as linear prose narratives, or not as narratives at all, will frequently be subdivided in a similar way: a drama into acts and scenes; a reference book into sections; a diary or day book into entries; a newspaper into issues and sections, and so forth.",

It is clear, however, that strong and consistent structural principles do govern the vast majority of conventional dictionaries, as well as many or most entries even in more exotic dictionaries; encoding guidelines should include these structural principles. We therefore define two distinct elements for dictionary entries, one (entry) which captures the regularities of many conventional dictionary entries, and a second (entryFree) which uses the same elements, but allows them to combine much more freely. It is however recommended that entry be used in preference to entryFree wherever possible.

Since both of these views of the dictionary may be of interest, it proves necessary to develop methods of recording both, and of recording the interrelationship between them as well. Users interested mainly in the printed format of the dictionary will require an encoding to be faithful to an original printed version. However, other users will be interested primarily in capturing the lexical information in a dictionary in a form suitable for further processing, which may demand the expansion or rearrangement of the information contained in the printed form. Further, some users wish to encode both of these views of the data, and retain the links between related elements of the two encodings.

These elements, facsimile, sourceDoc, and their children, may be used in parallel and in combination with an encoding of logical text structures with text, or as standalone representations. The element sourceDoc in particular provides a way of combining facsimile and transcriptions by embedding transcribed text. This approach focuses on physical and textual features that can be primarily described spatially, such as the sequence of pages in a manuscript, or the layout of a printed page.

Information concerning variant readings of a text may be accumulated in highly structured form in a critical apparatus of variants. This chapter defines a module for use in encoding such an apparatus of variants, which may be used in conjunction with any of the modules defined in these Guidelines. It also defines an element class which provides extra attributes for some elements of the core tag set when this module is selected. In printed critical editions, the apparatus takes the form of highly-compressed notes at the bottom of each page. TEI’s critical apparatus module allows variation to be encoded so that such notes may be generated, but it also models the variation so that, for example, interactive editions in which readers can choose which witness readings to display are possible.",

Are there many witnesses, few, or one? Are the sources relatively close copies or not? Will there be a single base text? Or will witnesses be separately transcribed? If a single base text will be used, will it be that of a particular witness, or will the editor attempt to reconstruct an ideal or original text? Will each reading in an apparatus entry record every attestation (a positive apparatus), or merely witnesses that deviate from the base text (a negative apparatus)? Will the readings of most or all witnesses be represented in the apparatus, or only a selection the editor deems relevant? What level of variation will require distinguishing one witness reading from another? For example, will the editor consider an abbreviated word in a witness as agreeing with the base text, or not? Will conjectures (variant readings suggested by an editor) be treated differently than readings found in witnesses? Will there be a need to distinguish different types of variation, for example orthographic vs. morphological or lexical variants?",

The parallel segmentation method may present several advantages to editors producing an edition with a single base text. Editors of single-source editions may care to note material aspects of the text (such as damage or unclear text). On the other hand, editors attempting to synthesize an ideal or original text from many witnesses may feel little need to represent the material aspects of individual witnesses. Editors wishing to distinguish witness readings from conjectures by modern editors may wish to use wit to indicate the former and source for the latter.

A simple (perhaps too simple to be useful) binary classification of age brackets would be child and adult. The actual age brackets useful to various projects are likely to be varied and idiosyncratic, and thus these Guidelines make no particular recommendation as to possible values. Instead, individual projects are recommended to define the values they use in their own customization file, using a declaration like the following: less than 18 years of age 18 to 65 years of age over 65 years of age The above declaration, were it properly placed in a customization file, establishes that the age attribute of person has only three possible values, child, adult, and retired.

Using A as a short form for an element with its attribute xml:id set to the value A , and suppose elements A1, A2, and A3 occur in that order and form one group, while elements B1, B2, and B3 occur in that order and form another group. Then a relation in which A1 corresponds to B1, A2 corresponds to B2, and A3 corresponds to B3 is an alignment. On the other hand, a relation in which A1 corresponds to B2, B1 to C2, and C1 to A2 is not an alignment. to synchronize elements of a text, that is to represent temporal correspondences and alignments among text elements (section #SASY (Synchronization) ) and also to align them with specific points in time (section #SASYMP (Placing Synchronous Events in Time) ); to specify that one text element is identical to or a copy of another (section #SAIE (Identical Elements and Virtual Copies) ); to aggregate possibly noncontiguous elements (section #SAAG (Aggregation) ); to specify that different elements are alternatives to one another and to express preferences among the alternatives (section #SAAT (Alternation) ); to store markup separately from the data it describes or is related to (section #SASO (Stand-off Markup) ); to associate segments of a text with interpretations or analyses of their significance (section #SAAN (Connecting Analytic and Textual Markup) ); to group together elements used to provide stand-off annotation, including contextual information (section #SASOstdf (The standOff Container) ).",

Feature structures represent the interrelations among various pieces of information, and their instantiation in markup provides a metalanguage for the generic representation of analyses and interpretations.

In linguistic application, such a system of constraints is the principal means by which the grammar of some natural language is expressed. There is a great deal of disagreement as to what, if any, model-theoretic interpretation feature structures have in such applications, but the status of this formal kind of interpretation is not germane to the present document.

Conflict between metrical, rhetorical, or linguistic structure and the representation of direct speech, especially if the quoted speech is interrupted by other elements (e.g., What, she asked, was that all about) or crosses metrical, rhetorical, or linguistic boundaries.

The various solutions to the problem will be exemplified using extracts from two poems.

The second example is the third stanza from the fourth section of Robert Pinsky's Essay on Psychiatrists: Catholic woman of twenty-seven with five children And a first-rate body—pointed her finger at the back of one certain man and asked me, \"Is that guy a psychiatrist?\" and by god he was! \"Yes,\" She said, \"He looks like a psychiatrist.\" Grown quiet, I looked at his pink back, and thought. These two texts can be analysed in various ways. The first, which we might describe as the Metrical View, encodes the text according to its metrical features: line divisions (as here), stanzas or cantos in larger poems, and perhaps prosodic features like stress or syllable patterns, alliteration, or rhyme. A second view, which we might describe as the Grammatical, encodes linguistic and rhetorical features: phonemes, morphemes, words, phrases, clauses, and sentences. A third view, the Dialogic, might concentrate on narrative voice: distinguishing between the narrator and their interlocutors and identifying individual segments as direct quotations. In our examples, we will restrict ourselves to relatively simple conflicts: for the Metrical View we will encode only metrical lines and line groups; for the Grammatical View we will restrict ourselves to encoding sentences; and for the Dialogic View, we only will distinguish direct quotation from other narration.",

For reasons of backwards compatibility, the ISO standard XML schema language RELAX NG (http:\/\/www.relaxng.org () ) may be used as a means of declaring content models and datatypes, but it is also possible to express content models using native TEI XML constructs.

In this sense, they provide both a document type definition and a document type declaration. More exactly, we may distinguish between the TEI Abstract Model, which defines a set of related concepts, and the TEI schema which defines a set of syntactic rules and constraints. Many (though not all) of the semantic recommendations are provided solely as informal descriptive prose, though some of them are also enforced by means of such constructs as datatypes (see #DTYPES (Datatype Specifications) ), or by schema constraints expressed using the Schematron language. Schematron constraints provide information about special kinds of validation errors dependent on conditional relationships, such as the invalidity of an attribute name or value on one element when another is present, or when, given a pair of attributes such as minOccurs and maxOccurs, the minimum value exceeds the maximum value. Schematron constraints also provide warnings when a particular element, attribute, or combination is to be deprecated in future releases of the TEI scheme, to alert users that the feature in question is no longer to be used after a certain date. Very rarely, TEI Schematron constraints offer warnings that do not explicitly break with the TEI but suggest a more efficient or less ambiguous encoding. Although the descriptions, validation errors, and warnings have been written with care, there will inevitably be cases where the intention of the contributors has not been conveyed with sufficient clarity to prevent users of these Guidelines from extending them in the sense of attaching slightly variant semantics to them.",

The mechanisms used to instantiate a TEI schema differ for different schema languages, and are therefore not defined here. In XML DTDs, for example, extensive use is made of parameter entities, while in RELAX NG schemas, extensive use is made of patterns. In either case, the names of elements and, wherever possible, their attributes and content models are defined indirectly.

The TEI customization mechanisms allow the user to control this behaviour as follows: particular elements may be suppressed, removing them from any classes in which they are members, and also from any generated schema; new elements may be added to an existing class, thus making them available in macros or content models defined in terms of those classes; additional attributes, or attribute values, may be specified for an individual element or for classes of elements; within certain limits, attributes, or attribute values, may also be removed either from an individual element or for classes of elements; the characteristics inherited by one class from another class may be modified by modifying its class membership: all members of the class then inherit the changed characteristics; the set of values legal for an attribute or attribute class may be constrained or relaxed by supplying or modifying a value list, or by modifying its datatype. within certain limits, the name (generic identifier) associated with an element may be changed, without changing the semantic or syntactic properties of the element; The modification mechanisms presented in this section are quite general, and may be used to make all the types of changes just listed.",

Those semantic and structural properties are also a part of the TEI Abstract Model; the class membership of an existing TEI element cannot therefore be changed without changing the model. Elements can however be removed from a class by deletion, and new non-TEI elements within their own namespaces can be added to existing TEI classes.",
