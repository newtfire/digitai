          "In addition to the elements and attributes so far discussed, an XML document can contain a few other formally distinct things. An XML document may contain references to predefined strings of data that a validator must resolve before attempting to validate the document's structure; these are called entity references. They may be useful as a means of providing boilerplate text or representing character data which cannot easily be keyboarded. As noted earlier, an XML document may also contain instances of elements taken from some other namespace. And an XML document may also contain arbitrary signals or flags for use when the document is processed in a particular way by some class of processor (a common example in document production is the need to force a formatter to start a new page at some specific point in a document); such flags are called processing instructions. We discuss each of these three cases in the rest of this section.",
          "The XML declaration should be supplied at the very beginning of every XML file; while it looks like a processing instruction, it is not, and may not occur anywhere other than at the very beginning of an XML file. For example: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> The XML declaration specifies the version number of the XML Recommendation applicable to the document it introduces (in this case, version 1.0), and optionally also the character encoding used to represent the Unicode characters within it. By default an XML document uses the character encoding UTF-8 or UTF-16; other commonly-encountered encodings include ISO 8859-1. If any character present in the document is not available in the specified character encoding, it must be represented as a character reference (#SG-er (Character References) ). The XML declaration is documentary, but should normally be supplied at the start of any XML file. If it is missing many XML-aware processors will be unable to process the associated text correctly."

          "A valid XML document necessarily specifies or implies some schema within which its constituent elements are defined and rules about their usage are given: this is a part of what it means to be valid. By contrast, a well formed XML document is not required to specify a schema at all. Nonetheless, it may well be useful to indicate that the element names used in it have some defined provenance. It might also be desirable to include in a document elements that are defined (possibly differently) in different schemas. A cabinet-maker's schema might well define an element called table with very different characteristics from those of a documentalist's.",
          "The concept of namespace was introduced into the XML language as a means of addressing these and related problems. If the markup of an XML document is thought of as an expression in some language, then a namespace may be thought of as analogous to the lexicon of that language. Just as a document can contain words taken from different languages, so a well-formed XML document can include elements taken from different namespaces. A namespace resembles a schema in that we may say that a given set of elements belongs to a given namespace, or are defined by a given schema. However, a schema is a set of element definitions, whereas a namespace is really only a property of a collection of elements: the only tangible form it takes in an XML document is its distinctive prefix and the identifying name associated with it.",
          "Suppose for example that we wish to extend our anthology to include a complex diagram. We might start by considering whether or not to extend our simple schema to include XML markup for such features as arcs, polygons, and other graphical elements. XML can be used to represent any kind of structure, not simply text, and there are clear advantages to having our text and our diagrams all expressed in the same way.",
          "Fortunately we do not need to invent a schema for the representation of graphical components such as diagrams; it already exists in the shape of the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) language defined by the W3C.The W3C Recommendation is defined at https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/ () . SVG is a widely used and rich XML vocabulary for representing all kinds of two-dimensional graphics; it is also well supported by existing software. Using an SVG-aware drawing package, we can easily draw our diagram and save it in XML format for inclusion within our anthology. When we do so, we need to indicate that this part of the document contains elements taken from the SVG namespace, if only to ensure that processing software does not confuse our line element with the SVG line, which means something quite different.",
          "An XML document need not specify any namespace: it is then said to use the null namespace. Alternatively, the root element of a document may supply a default namespace, understood to apply to all elements which have no namespace prefix. This is the function of the xmlns attribute which provides a unique name for the default namespace, in the form of a URI: In exactly the same way, on the root element for each part of our document which uses the SVG language, we might introduce the SVG namespace name: Although a namespace name usually uses the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) syntax, it is not treated as an online address and an XML processor regards it just as a string, providing a longer name for the namespace.",
          "The xmlns attribute can also be used to associate a short prefix name with the namespace it defines. This is very useful if we want to mingle elements from different namespaces within the same document, since the prefix can be attached to any element, overriding the implicit namespace for itself (but not its children):",
          "There is no limit on the number of namespaces that a document can use. Provided that each is uniquely identified, an XML processor can identify those that are relevant, and validate them appropriately. To extend our example further, we might decide to add a linguistic analysis to each of the poems, using a set of elements such as aux, adj, etc., derived from some pre-existing XML vocabulary for linguistic analysis.

We envisage a number of users and uses for these elements. For example, an encoder may be interested in creating or converting a set of biographical records of the type found in a Dictionary of National Biography. Another use is the creation or conversion of a database-like collection of information about a group of people, such as the people referenced in a marked-up collection of documents, or persons who have served as informants in the creation of spoken corpora. It is also appropriate to use these elements to register information relating to those who have taken part in the creation of a TEI document.",

If one were interested, for example, in converting existing DNB-type records, and wanted to preserve the text as is, the person element (see #NDPERSE (The Person Element) ) could simply contain the text of an article, placed within p elements, possibly using elements such as name or date to mark up features of that text. For a more structured entry, however, one would extract the data and place information contained in the text, and encode it directly using the more specific elements described in this section."

Instead, individual projects are recommended to define the values they use in their own customization file, using a declaration like the following: less than 18 years of age 18 to 65 years of age over 65 years of age The above declaration, were it properly placed in a customization file, establishes that the age attribute of person has only three possible values, child, adult, and retired.

          "This module defines a number of special purpose elements which can be used to markup biographical, historical, and prosopographical data. We envisage a number of users and uses for these elements. For example, an encoder may be interested in creating or converting a set of biographical records of the type found in a Dictionary of National Biography. Another use is the creation or conversion of a database-like collection of information about a group of people, such as the people referenced in a marked-up collection of documents, or persons who have served as informants in the creation of spoken corpora. It is also appropriate to use these elements to register information relating to those who have taken part in the creation of a TEI document.",
          "To cater for this diversity, these Guidelines propose a flexible strategy, in which encoders may choose for themselves the approach appropriate to their needs. If one were interested, for example, in converting existing DNB-type records, and wanted to preserve the text as is, the person element (see #NDPERSE (The Person Element) ) could simply contain the text of an article, placed within p elements, possibly using elements such as name or date to mark up features of that text. For a more structured entry, however, one would extract the data and place information contained in the text, and encode it directly using the more specific elements described in this section."

          "This module defines a number of special purpose elements which can be used to markup biographical, historical, and prosopographical data. We envisage a number of users and uses for these elements. For example, an encoder may be interested in creating or converting a set of biographical records of the type found in a Dictionary of National Biography. Another use is the creation or conversion of a database-like collection of information about a group of people, such as the people referenced in a marked-up collection of documents, or persons who have served as informants in the creation of spoken corpora. It is also appropriate to use these elements to register information relating to those who have taken part in the creation of a TEI document.",
          "To cater for this diversity, these Guidelines propose a flexible strategy, in which encoders may choose for themselves the approach appropriate to their needs. If one were interested, for example, in converting existing DNB-type records, and wanted to preserve the text as is, the person element (see #NDPERSE (The Person Element) ) could simply contain the text of an article, placed within p elements, possibly using elements such as name or date to mark up features of that text. For a more structured entry, however, one would extract the data and place information contained in the text, and encode it directly using the more specific elements described in this section."

Rather it is intended to record into which age bracket, for the purposes of some analysis, the person falls. A simple (perhaps too simple to be useful) binary classification of age brackets would be child and adult. The actual age brackets useful to various projects are likely to be varied and idiosyncratic, and thus these Guidelines make no particular recommendation as to possible values. Instead, individual projects are recommended to define the values they use in their own customization file, using a declaration like the following: less than 18 years of age 18 to 65 years of age over 65 years of age The above declaration, were it properly placed in a customization file, establishes that the age attribute of person has only three possible values, child, adult, and retired.

          "Bibliographic references (that is, full descriptions of bibliographic items such as books, articles, films, broadcasts, songs, etc.) or pointers to them may appear at various places in a TEI text. They are required at several points within the TEI header's source description, as discussed in section #HD3 (The Source Description) ; they may also appear within the body of a text, either singly (for example within a footnote), or collected together in a list as a distinct part of a text; detailed bibliographic descriptions of manuscript or other source materials may also be required. These Guidelines propose a number of specialized elements to encode such descriptions, which together constitute the model.biblLike class. Lists of such elements may also be encoded using the following element:",
          "In printed texts, the individual constituents of a bibliographic reference are conventionally marked off from each other and from the flow of text by such features as bracketing, italics, special punctuation conventions, underlining, etc. In electronic texts, such distinctions are also important, whether in order to produce acceptably formatted output or to facilitate intelligent retrieval processing,For example, to distinguish London as an author's name from London as a place of publication or as a component of a title. quite apart from the need to distinguish the reference itself as a textual object with particular linguistic properties.",
          "It should be emphasized that for references as for other textual features, the primary or sole consideration is not how the text should be formatted when it is printed or displayed. The distinctions permitted by the scheme outlined here may not necessarily be all that particular formatters or bibliographic styles require, although they should prove adequate to the needs of many such commonly used software systems.Among the bibliographic software systems and subsystems consulted in the design of the biblStruct structure were BibTeX, Scribe, and ProCite. The distinctions made by all three may be preserved in biblStruct structures, though the nature of their design prevents a simple one-to-one mapping from their data elements to TEI elements. For further information, see section #COBIOT (Relationship to Other Bibliographic Schemes) . The features distinguished and described below (in section #COBICO (Components of Bibliographic References) ) constitute a set which has been useful for a wide range of bibliographic purposes and in many applications, and which moreover corresponds to a great extent with existing bibliographic and library cataloguing practice. For a fuller account of that practice as applied to electronic texts see section #HD3 (The Source Description) ; for a brief mention of related library standards see section #HD8 (Note for Library Cataloguers) .",
          "The most commonly used elements in the model.biblLike class are biblStruct and bibl. biblStruct will usually be easier to process mechanically than bibl because its structure is more constrained and predictable. It is suited to situations in which the objective is to represent bibliographic information for machine processing directly by other systems or after conversion to some other bibliographic markup formats such as BibTeXML or MODS. Punctuation delimiting the components of a print citation is not permitted directly within a biblStruct element; instead, the presence and order of child elements must be used to reconstruct the punctuation required by a particular style.",
          "By contrast, bibl allows for considerable flexibility in that it can include both delimiting punctuation and unmarked-up text; and its constituents can also be ordered in any way. This makes it suitable for marking up bibliographies in existing documents, where it is considered important to preserve the form of references in the original document, while also distinguishing important pieces of information such as authors, dates, publishers, and so on. bibl may also be useful when encoding born digital documents which require use of a specific style guide when rendering the content; its flexibility makes it easier to provide all the information for a reference in the exact sequence required by the target rendering, including any necessary punctuation and linking words, rather than using an XSLT stylesheet or similar to reorder and punctuate the data.",
          "The third element in the model.biblLike class, biblFull, has a content model based on the fileDesc element of the TEI header. Both are based on the International Standard for Bibliographic Description (ISBD), which forms the basis of several national standards for bibliographic citations. The order of child elements in both biblFull and fileDesc corresponds to the order of bibliographic description areas in ISBD with two minor exceptions. First, the extent element, corresponding to the physical description area in ISBD, appears just after the publication, production, distribution, etc. area in ISBD, not before it as in TEI. Second, biblFull and fileDesc use the child element publicationStmt to cover not only the publication, production, distribution, etc. area but also the resource identifier and terms of availability area associated with that publication. Despite these inconsistencies, users encoding citations and attempting to format them according to a standard that closely adheres to ISBD may find that biblFull, used with its child elements and without delimiting punctuation, provides an appropriate granularity of encoding with elements that can easily be rendered for the reader. However, it is important to note that some ISBD-derived citation formats (such as ANSI/NISO Z39.29 and ГОСТ 7.1) are not entirely conformant to ISBD either, since they may begin with a statement of authorship that does not map to the ISBD statement of responsibility."

These Guidelines propose a number of specialized elements to encode such descriptions, which together constitute the model.biblLike class. Lists of such elements may also be encoded using the following element:",
          "In printed texts, the individual constituents of a bibliographic reference are conventionally marked off from each other and from the flow of text by such features as bracketing, italics, special punctuation conventions, underlining, etc. In electronic texts, such distinctions are also important, whether in order to produce acceptably formatted output or to facilitate intelligent retrieval processing,For example, to distinguish London as an author's name from London as a place of publication or as a component of a title. quite apart from the need to distinguish the reference itself as a textual object with particular linguistic properties.",
          "It should be emphasized that for references as for other textual features, the primary or sole consideration is not how the text should be formatted when it is printed or displayed. The distinctions permitted by the scheme outlined here may not necessarily be all that particular formatters or bibliographic styles require, although they should prove adequate to the needs of many such commonly used software systems.Among the bibliographic software systems and subsystems consulted in the design of the biblStruct structure were BibTeX, Scribe, and ProCite. The distinctions made by all three may be preserved in biblStruct structures, though the nature of their design prevents a simple one-to-one mapping from their data elements to TEI elements. For further information, see section #COBIOT (Relationship to Other Bibliographic Schemes) . The features distinguished and described below (in section #COBICO (Components of Bibliographic References) ) constitute a set which has been useful for a wide range of bibliographic purposes and in many applications, and which moreover corresponds to a great extent with existing bibliographic and library cataloguing practice. For a fuller account of that practice as applied to electronic texts see section #HD3 (The Source Description) ; for a brief mention of related library standards see section #HD8 (Note for Library Cataloguers) .",
          "The most commonly used elements in the model.biblLike class are biblStruct and bibl. biblStruct will usually be easier to process mechanically than bibl because its structure is more constrained and predictable. It is suited to situations in which the objective is to represent bibliographic information for machine processing directly by other systems or after conversion to some other bibliographic markup formats such as BibTeXML or MODS. Punctuation delimiting the components of a print citation is not permitted directly within a biblStruct element; instead, the presence and order of child elements must be used to reconstruct the punctuation required by a particular style.",
          "By contrast, bibl allows for considerable flexibility in that it can include both delimiting punctuation and unmarked-up text; and its constituents can also be ordered in any way. This makes it suitable for marking up bibliographies in existing documents, where it is considered important to preserve the form of references in the original document, while also distinguishing important pieces of information such as authors, dates, publishers, and so on. bibl may also be useful when encoding born digital documents which require use of a specific style guide when rendering the content; its flexibility makes it easier to provide all the information for a reference in the exact sequence required by the target rendering, including any necessary punctuation and linking words, rather than using an XSLT stylesheet or similar to reorder and punctuate the data.",
          "The third element in the model.biblLike class, biblFull, has a content model based on the fileDesc element of the TEI header. Both are based on the International Standard for Bibliographic Description (ISBD), which forms the basis of several national standards for bibliographic citations. The order of child elements in both biblFull and fileDesc corresponds to the order of bibliographic description areas in ISBD with two minor exceptions. First, the extent element, corresponding to the physical description area in ISBD, appears just after the publication, production, distribution, etc. area in ISBD, not before it as in TEI. Second, biblFull and fileDesc use the child element publicationStmt to cover not only the publication, production, distribution, etc. area but also the resource identifier and terms of availability area associated with that publication. Despite these inconsistencies, users encoding citations and attempting to format them according to a standard that closely adheres to ISBD may find that biblFull, used with its child elements and without delimiting punctuation, provides an appropriate granularity of encoding with elements that can easily be rendered for the reader. However, it is important to note that some ISBD-derived citation formats (such as ANSI/NISO Z39.29 and ГОСТ 7.1) are not entirely conformant to ISBD either, since they may begin with a statement of authorship that does not map to the ISBD statement of responsibility."

          "Bibliographic references (that is, full descriptions of bibliographic items such as books, articles, films, broadcasts, songs, etc.) or pointers to them may appear at various places in a TEI text. They are required at several points within the TEI header's source description, as discussed in section #HD3 (The Source Description) ; they may also appear within the body of a text, either singly (for example within a footnote), or collected together in a list as a distinct part of a text; detailed bibliographic descriptions of manuscript or other source materials may also be required. These Guidelines propose a number of specialized elements to encode such descriptions, which together constitute the model.biblLike class. Lists of such elements may also be encoded using the following element:",
          "In printed texts, the individual constituents of a bibliographic reference are conventionally marked off from each other and from the flow of text by such features as bracketing, italics, special punctuation conventions, underlining, etc. In electronic texts, such distinctions are also important, whether in order to produce acceptably formatted output or to facilitate intelligent retrieval processing,For example, to distinguish London as an author's name from London as a place of publication or as a component of a title. quite apart from the need to distinguish the reference itself as a textual object with particular linguistic properties.",
          "It should be emphasized that for references as for other textual features, the primary or sole consideration is not how the text should be formatted when it is printed or displayed. The distinctions permitted by the scheme outlined here may not necessarily be all that particular formatters or bibliographic styles require, although they should prove adequate to the needs of many such commonly used software systems.Among the bibliographic software systems and subsystems consulted in the design of the biblStruct structure were BibTeX, Scribe, and ProCite. The distinctions made by all three may be preserved in biblStruct structures, though the nature of their design prevents a simple one-to-one mapping from their data elements to TEI elements. For further information, see section #COBIOT (Relationship to Other Bibliographic Schemes) . The features distinguished and described below (in section #COBICO (Components of Bibliographic References) ) constitute a set which has been useful for a wide range of bibliographic purposes and in many applications, and which moreover corresponds to a great extent with existing bibliographic and library cataloguing practice. For a fuller account of that practice as applied to electronic texts see section #HD3 (The Source Description) ; for a brief mention of related library standards see section #HD8 (Note for Library Cataloguers) .",
          "The most commonly used elements in the model.biblLike class are biblStruct and bibl. biblStruct will usually be easier to process mechanically than bibl because its structure is more constrained and predictable. It is suited to situations in which the objective is to represent bibliographic information for machine processing directly by other systems or after conversion to some other bibliographic markup formats such as BibTeXML or MODS. Punctuation delimiting the components of a print citation is not permitted directly within a biblStruct element; instead, the presence and order of child elements must be used to reconstruct the punctuation required by a particular style.",
          "By contrast, bibl allows for considerable flexibility in that it can include both delimiting punctuation and unmarked-up text; and its constituents can also be ordered in any way. This makes it suitable for marking up bibliographies in existing documents, where it is considered important to preserve the form of references in the original document, while also distinguishing important pieces of information such as authors, dates, publishers, and so on. bibl may also be useful when encoding born digital documents which require use of a specific style guide when rendering the content; its flexibility makes it easier to provide all the information for a reference in the exact sequence required by the target rendering, including any necessary punctuation and linking words, rather than using an XSLT stylesheet or similar to reorder and punctuate the data.",
          "The third element in the model.biblLike class, biblFull, has a content model based on the fileDesc element of the TEI header. Both are based on the International Standard for Bibliographic Description (ISBD), which forms the basis of several national standards for bibliographic citations. The order of child elements in both biblFull and fileDesc corresponds to the order of bibliographic description areas in ISBD with two minor exceptions. First, the extent element, corresponding to the physical description area in ISBD, appears just after the publication, production, distribution, etc. area in ISBD, not before it as in TEI. Second, biblFull and fileDesc use the child element publicationStmt to cover not only the publication, production, distribution, etc. area but also the resource identifier and terms of availability area associated with that publication. Despite these inconsistencies, users encoding citations and attempting to format them according to a standard that closely adheres to ISBD may find that biblFull, used with its child elements and without delimiting punctuation, provides an appropriate granularity of encoding with elements that can easily be rendered for the reader. However, it is important to note that some ISBD-derived citation formats (such as ANSI/NISO Z39.29 and ГОСТ 7.1) are not entirely conformant to ISBD either, since they may begin with a statement of authorship that does not map to the ISBD statement of responsibility."

These Guidelines propose a number of specialized elements to encode such descriptions, which together constitute the model.biblLike class. Lists of such elements may also be encoded using the following element:",
          "In printed texts, the individual constituents of a bibliographic reference are conventionally marked off from each other and from the flow of text by such features as bracketing, italics, special punctuation conventions, underlining, etc. In electronic texts, such distinctions are also important, whether in order to produce acceptably formatted output or to facilitate intelligent retrieval processing,For example, to distinguish London as an author's name from London as a place of publication or as a component of a title. quite apart from the need to distinguish the reference itself as a textual object with particular linguistic properties.",
          "It should be emphasized that for references as for other textual features, the primary or sole consideration is not how the text should be formatted when it is printed or displayed. The distinctions permitted by the scheme outlined here may not necessarily be all that particular formatters or bibliographic styles require, although they should prove adequate to the needs of many such commonly used software systems.Among the bibliographic software systems and subsystems consulted in the design of the biblStruct structure were BibTeX, Scribe, and ProCite. The distinctions made by all three may be preserved in biblStruct structures, though the nature of their design prevents a simple one-to-one mapping from their data elements to TEI elements. For further information, see section #COBIOT (Relationship to Other Bibliographic Schemes) . The features distinguished and described below (in section #COBICO (Components of Bibliographic References) ) constitute a set which has been useful for a wide range of bibliographic purposes and in many applications, and which moreover corresponds to a great extent with existing bibliographic and library cataloguing practice. For a fuller account of that practice as applied to electronic texts see section #HD3 (The Source Description) ; for a brief mention of related library standards see section #HD8 (Note for Library Cataloguers) .",
          "The most commonly used elements in the model.biblLike class are biblStruct and bibl. biblStruct will usually be easier to process mechanically than bibl because its structure is more constrained and predictable. It is suited to situations in which the objective is to represent bibliographic information for machine processing directly by other systems or after conversion to some other bibliographic markup formats such as BibTeXML or MODS. Punctuation delimiting the components of a print citation is not permitted directly within a biblStruct element; instead, the presence and order of child elements must be used to reconstruct the punctuation required by a particular style.",
          "By contrast, bibl allows for considerable flexibility in that it can include both delimiting punctuation and unmarked-up text; and its constituents can also be ordered in any way. This makes it suitable for marking up bibliographies in existing documents, where it is considered important to preserve the form of references in the original document, while also distinguishing important pieces of information such as authors, dates, publishers, and so on. bibl may also be useful when encoding born digital documents which require use of a specific style guide when rendering the content; its flexibility makes it easier to provide all the information for a reference in the exact sequence required by the target rendering, including any necessary punctuation and linking words, rather than using an XSLT stylesheet or similar to reorder and punctuate the data.",
          "The third element in the model.biblLike class, biblFull, has a content model based on the fileDesc element of the TEI header. Both are based on the International Standard for Bibliographic Description (ISBD), which forms the basis of several national standards for bibliographic citations. The order of child elements in both biblFull and fileDesc corresponds to the order of bibliographic description areas in ISBD with two minor exceptions. First, the extent element, corresponding to the physical description area in ISBD, appears just after the publication, production, distribution, etc. area in ISBD, not before it as in TEI. Second, biblFull and fileDesc use the child element publicationStmt to cover not only the publication, production, distribution, etc. area but also the resource identifier and terms of availability area associated with that publication. Despite these inconsistencies, users encoding citations and attempting to format them according to a standard that closely adheres to ISBD may find that biblFull, used with its child elements and without delimiting punctuation, provides an appropriate granularity of encoding with elements that can easily be rendered for the reader. However, it is important to note that some ISBD-derived citation formats (such as ANSI/NISO Z39.29 and ГОСТ 7.1) are not entirely conformant to ISBD either, since they may begin with a statement of authorship that does not map to the ISBD statement of responsibility."

          "Bibliographic references (that is, full descriptions of bibliographic items such as books, articles, films, broadcasts, songs, etc.) or pointers to them may appear at various places in a TEI text. They are required at several points within the TEI header's source description, as discussed in section #HD3 (The Source Description) ; they may also appear within the body of a text, either singly (for example within a footnote), or collected together in a list as a distinct part of a text; detailed bibliographic descriptions of manuscript or other source materials may also be required. These Guidelines propose a number of specialized elements to encode such descriptions, which together constitute the model.biblLike class. Lists of such elements may also be encoded using the following element:",
          "In printed texts, the individual constituents of a bibliographic reference are conventionally marked off from each other and from the flow of text by such features as bracketing, italics, special punctuation conventions, underlining, etc. In electronic texts, such distinctions are also important, whether in order to produce acceptably formatted output or to facilitate intelligent retrieval processing,For example, to distinguish London as an author's name from London as a place of publication or as a component of a title. quite apart from the need to distinguish the reference itself as a textual object with particular linguistic properties.",
          "It should be emphasized that for references as for other textual features, the primary or sole consideration is not how the text should be formatted when it is printed or displayed. The distinctions permitted by the scheme outlined here may not necessarily be all that particular formatters or bibliographic styles require, although they should prove adequate to the needs of many such commonly used software systems.Among the bibliographic software systems and subsystems consulted in the design of the biblStruct structure were BibTeX, Scribe, and ProCite. The distinctions made by all three may be preserved in biblStruct structures, though the nature of their design prevents a simple one-to-one mapping from their data elements to TEI elements. For further information, see section #COBIOT (Relationship to Other Bibliographic Schemes) . The features distinguished and described below (in section #COBICO (Components of Bibliographic References) ) constitute a set which has been useful for a wide range of bibliographic purposes and in many applications, and which moreover corresponds to a great extent with existing bibliographic and library cataloguing practice. For a fuller account of that practice as applied to electronic texts see section #HD3 (The Source Description) ; for a brief mention of related library standards see section #HD8 (Note for Library Cataloguers) .",
          "The most commonly used elements in the model.biblLike class are biblStruct and bibl. biblStruct will usually be easier to process mechanically than bibl because its structure is more constrained and predictable. It is suited to situations in which the objective is to represent bibliographic information for machine processing directly by other systems or after conversion to some other bibliographic markup formats such as BibTeXML or MODS. Punctuation delimiting the components of a print citation is not permitted directly within a biblStruct element; instead, the presence and order of child elements must be used to reconstruct the punctuation required by a particular style.",
          "By contrast, bibl allows for considerable flexibility in that it can include both delimiting punctuation and unmarked-up text; and its constituents can also be ordered in any way. This makes it suitable for marking up bibliographies in existing documents, where it is considered important to preserve the form of references in the original document, while also distinguishing important pieces of information such as authors, dates, publishers, and so on. bibl may also be useful when encoding born digital documents which require use of a specific style guide when rendering the content; its flexibility makes it easier to provide all the information for a reference in the exact sequence required by the target rendering, including any necessary punctuation and linking words, rather than using an XSLT stylesheet or similar to reorder and punctuate the data.",
          "The third element in the model.biblLike class, biblFull, has a content model based on the fileDesc element of the TEI header. Both are based on the International Standard for Bibliographic Description (ISBD), which forms the basis of several national standards for bibliographic citations. The order of child elements in both biblFull and fileDesc corresponds to the order of bibliographic description areas in ISBD with two minor exceptions. First, the extent element, corresponding to the physical description area in ISBD, appears just after the publication, production, distribution, etc. area in ISBD, not before it as in TEI. Second, biblFull and fileDesc use the child element publicationStmt to cover not only the publication, production, distribution, etc. area but also the resource identifier and terms of availability area associated with that publication. Despite these inconsistencies, users encoding citations and attempting to format them according to a standard that closely adheres to ISBD may find that biblFull, used with its child elements and without delimiting punctuation, provides an appropriate granularity of encoding with elements that can easily be rendered for the reader. However, it is important to note that some ISBD-derived citation formats (such as ANSI/NISO Z39.29 and ГОСТ 7.1) are not entirely conformant to ISBD either, since they may begin with a statement of authorship that does not map to the ISBD statement of responsibility."

These Guidelines propose a number of specialized elements to encode such descriptions, which together constitute the model.biblLike class. Lists of such elements may also be encoded using the following element:",
          "In printed texts, the individual constituents of a bibliographic reference are conventionally marked off from each other and from the flow of text by such features as bracketing, italics, special punctuation conventions, underlining, etc. In electronic texts, such distinctions are also important, whether in order to produce acceptably formatted output or to facilitate intelligent retrieval processing,For example, to distinguish London as an author's name from London as a place of publication or as a component of a title. quite apart from the need to distinguish the reference itself as a textual object with particular linguistic properties.",
          "It should be emphasized that for references as for other textual features, the primary or sole consideration is not how the text should be formatted when it is printed or displayed. The distinctions permitted by the scheme outlined here may not necessarily be all that particular formatters or bibliographic styles require, although they should prove adequate to the needs of many such commonly used software systems.Among the bibliographic software systems and subsystems consulted in the design of the biblStruct structure were BibTeX, Scribe, and ProCite. The distinctions made by all three may be preserved in biblStruct structures, though the nature of their design prevents a simple one-to-one mapping from their data elements to TEI elements. For further information, see section #COBIOT (Relationship to Other Bibliographic Schemes) . The features distinguished and described below (in section #COBICO (Components of Bibliographic References) ) constitute a set which has been useful for a wide range of bibliographic purposes and in many applications, and which moreover corresponds to a great extent with existing bibliographic and library cataloguing practice. For a fuller account of that practice as applied to electronic texts see section #HD3 (The Source Description) ; for a brief mention of related library standards see section #HD8 (Note for Library Cataloguers) .",
          "The most commonly used elements in the model.biblLike class are biblStruct and bibl. biblStruct will usually be easier to process mechanically than bibl because its structure is more constrained and predictable. It is suited to situations in which the objective is to represent bibliographic information for machine processing directly by other systems or after conversion to some other bibliographic markup formats such as BibTeXML or MODS. Punctuation delimiting the components of a print citation is not permitted directly within a biblStruct element; instead, the presence and order of child elements must be used to reconstruct the punctuation required by a particular style.",
          "By contrast, bibl allows for considerable flexibility in that it can include both delimiting punctuation and unmarked-up text; and its constituents can also be ordered in any way. This makes it suitable for marking up bibliographies in existing documents, where it is considered important to preserve the form of references in the original document, while also distinguishing important pieces of information such as authors, dates, publishers, and so on. bibl may also be useful when encoding born digital documents which require use of a specific style guide when rendering the content; its flexibility makes it easier to provide all the information for a reference in the exact sequence required by the target rendering, including any necessary punctuation and linking words, rather than using an XSLT stylesheet or similar to reorder and punctuate the data.",
          "The third element in the model.biblLike class, biblFull, has a content model based on the fileDesc element of the TEI header. Both are based on the International Standard for Bibliographic Description (ISBD), which forms the basis of several national standards for bibliographic citations. The order of child elements in both biblFull and fileDesc corresponds to the order of bibliographic description areas in ISBD with two minor exceptions. First, the extent element, corresponding to the physical description area in ISBD, appears just after the publication, production, distribution, etc. area in ISBD, not before it as in TEI. Second, biblFull and fileDesc use the child element publicationStmt to cover not only the publication, production, distribution, etc. area but also the resource identifier and terms of availability area associated with that publication. Despite these inconsistencies, users encoding citations and attempting to format them according to a standard that closely adheres to ISBD may find that biblFull, used with its child elements and without delimiting punctuation, provides an appropriate granularity of encoding with elements that can easily be rendered for the reader. However, it is important to note that some ISBD-derived citation formats (such as ANSI/NISO Z39.29 and ГОСТ 7.1) are not entirely conformant to ISBD either, since they may begin with a statement of authorship that does not map to the ISBD statement of responsibility."

These include: aspects of the form, support, extent, and quire structure of the manuscript object and of the way in which the text is laid out on the page (#msph1 (Object Description) ); the styles of writing, such as the way it is laid out on the page, the styles of writing, decorative features, any musical notation employed and any annotations or marginalia (#msph2 (Writing, Decoration, and Other Notations) ); and discussion of its binding, seals, and any accompanying material (#msph3 (Bindings, Seals, and Additional Material) ).",
          "Most manuscript descriptions touch on several of these categories of information though few include them all, and not all distinguish them as clearly as we propose here. In particular, it is often the case that an existing description will include information for which we propose distinct elements within a single paragraph, or even sentence. The encoder must then decide whether to rewrite the description using the structure proposed here, or to retain the existing prose, marked up simply as a series of p elements, directly within the physDesc element.",
          "The physDesc element may thus be used in either of two distinct ways. It may contain a series of paragraphs addressing topics listed above and similar ones. Alternatively, it may act as a container for any choice of the more specialized elements described in the remainder of this section, each of which itself contains a series of paragraphs, and may also have more specific attributes.",
          "In general, it is not recommended to combine unstructured prose description with usage of the more specialized elements, as such an approach complicates processing, and may lead to inconsistency within a single manuscript description. A single physDesc element will normally contain either a series of model.pLike elements, or a sequence of specialized elements from the model.physDescPart class. There are however circumstances in which this is not feasible, for example: the description already exists in a prose form where some of the specialized topics are treated together in paragraphs of prose, but others are treated distinctly; although all parts of the description are clearly distinguished, some of them cannot be mapped to a pre-existing specialized element.",
          "In such situations, both specialized and generic (model.pLike) elements may be combined in a single physDesc. Note however that all generic elements given must precede the first specialized element in the description. Thus the following is valid: Generic descriptive prose... but neither of the following is valid: <physDesc> <objectDesc form=\"codex\"> <!-- ... --> </objectDesc> <p>Generic descriptive prose...</p> </physDesc> <physDesc> <objectDesc form=\"codex\"> <!-- ... --> </objectDesc> <p>Generic descriptive prose...</p> <!-- other specific elements here --> </physDesc> The order in which specific elements may appear is also constrained by the content model; again this is for simplicity of processing. They may of course be processed or displayed in any desired order, but for ease of validation, they must be given in the order specified below."

          "In general, it is not recommended to combine unstructured prose description with usage of the more specialized elements, as such an approach complicates processing, and may lead to inconsistency within a single manuscript description. A single physDesc element will normally contain either a series of model.pLike elements, or a sequence of specialized elements from the model.physDescPart class. There are however circumstances in which this is not feasible, for example: the description already exists in a prose form where some of the specialized topics are treated together in paragraphs of prose, but others are treated distinctly; although all parts of the description are clearly distinguished, some of them cannot be mapped to a pre-existing specialized element.",
          "In such situations, both specialized and generic (model.pLike) elements may be combined in a single physDesc. Note however that all generic elements given must precede the first specialized element in the description. Thus the following is valid: Generic descriptive prose... but neither of the following is valid: <physDesc> <objectDesc form=\"codex\"> <!-- ... --> </objectDesc> <p>Generic descriptive prose...</p> </physDesc> <physDesc> <objectDesc form=\"codex\"> <!-- ... --> </objectDesc> <p>Generic descriptive prose...</p> <!-- other specific elements here --> </physDesc> The order in which specific elements may appear is also constrained by the content model; again this is for simplicity of processing. They may of course be processed or displayed in any desired order, but for ease of validation, they must be given in the order specified below."

Unlike choice, however, the app element allows for the representation of many different versions of the same passage taken from different sources."

          "This module defines a number of special purpose elements which can be used to markup biographical, historical, and prosopographical data. We envisage a number of users and uses for these elements. For example, an encoder may be interested in creating or converting a set of biographical records of the type found in a Dictionary of National Biography. Another use is the creation or conversion of a database-like collection of information about a group of people, such as the people referenced in a marked-up collection of documents, or persons who have served as informants in the creation of spoken corpora. It is also appropriate to use these elements to register information relating to those who have taken part in the creation of a TEI document.",
          "To cater for this diversity, these Guidelines propose a flexible strategy, in which encoders may choose for themselves the approach appropriate to their needs. If one were interested, for example, in converting existing DNB-type records, and wanted to preserve the text as is, the person element (see #NDPERSE (The Person Element) ) could simply contain the text of an article, placed within p elements, possibly using elements such as name or date to mark up features of that text. For a more structured entry, however, one would extract the data and place information contained in the text, and encode it directly using the more specific elements described in this section."

Information about a group of people regarded as a single entity (for example the audience of a performance) may be encoded using the personGrp element. Note however that information about a group of people with a distinct identity (for example a named theatrical troupe) should be recorded using the org element described in section #ND-org (Organizational Data) below.",
          "These elements may appear only within a listPerson element, which groups such descriptions together, and optionally also describes relationships amongst the people listed.",

Like other forms of list, however, listPerson can also appear within the body of a text when the module defined by this chapter is included in a schema.",
          "The type attribute may be used to distinguish lists of people of different kinds where this is considered convenient: Adam Schiff District Attorney for Manhattan in seasons 1 to 10 of Law and Order. Mike Logan NYPD New York Police Department Detective regularly appearing in seasons 1 to 5 of Law and Order and seasons 5 to 7 of Law and Order: Criminal Intent.

          "The person element carries several attributes. As a member of the classes att.global.responsibility, att.editLike, and att.global.source class, it carries the usual attributes for providing details about the information recorded for that person, such as its reliability or source: In addition, a small number of very commonly used personal properties may be recorded using attributes specific to person and personGrp:",
          "These attributes are intended for use where only a small amount of data is to be encoded in a more or less normalized form, possibly for many person elements, for example when encoding basic facts about respondents to a questionnaire. When however a more detailed encoding is required for all kinds of information about a person, for example in a historical gazetteer, then it will be more appropriate to use the elements age, sex and others described elsewhere in this chapter.",
          "Note that the age attribute is not intended to record the person's age expressed in years, months, or other temporal unit. Rather it is intended to record into which age bracket, for the purposes of some analysis, the person falls. A simple (perhaps too simple to be useful) binary classification of age brackets would be child and adult. The actual age brackets useful to various projects are likely to be varied and idiosyncratic, and thus these Guidelines make no particular recommendation as to possible values. Instead, individual projects are recommended to define the values they use in their own customization file, using a declaration like the following: less than 18 years of age 18 to 65 years of age over 65 years of age The above declaration, were it properly placed in a customization file, establishes that the age attribute of person has only three possible values, child, adult, and retired. For more information on customization see #MD (Customization) .",
          "The person element may contain many sub-elements, each specifying a different property of the person being described. The remainder of this section describes these more specific elements. For convenience, these elements are grouped into three classes, corresponding with the tripartite division outlined above: one for traits, one for states and one for events. Each class may contain specific elements for common types of biographical information, and contains a generic element for other, user-defined, types of information.",
          "All the elements in these three classes belong to the attribute class att.datable, which provides the following attributes: as discussed in #NDATTS (Attribute Classes Defined by This Module) above."
