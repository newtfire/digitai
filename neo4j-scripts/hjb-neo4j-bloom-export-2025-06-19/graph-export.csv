The FSD serves three purposes: the encoder can list all of the feature names and feature values and give a prose description as to what each represents. the encoder can define what it means to be a well-formed feature structure','and define constraints which may be used to determine whether a particular feature structure is valid relative to a given theory stated in typed feature logic. These may involve constraints on the range of a feature value','constraints on what features are valid within certain types of feature structures','or constraints that prevent the co-occurrence of certain feature-value pairs. the encoder can define the intended interpretation of underspecified feature structures. This involves defining default values (whether literal or computed) for missing features. The scheme described in this chapter may be used to document any feature structure system','but is primarily intended for use with the feature structure representation defined by the ISO 24610-1:2006 standard','which corresponds with the recommendations presented in these Guidelines','FS (Feature Structures) . This chapter relies upon','but does not reproduce','formal definitions and descriptions presented more thoroughly in the ISO standard','which should be consulted in case of ambiguity or uncertainty. The FSD serves an important function in documenting precisely what the encoder intended by the system of feature structure markup used in an XML-encoded text. The FSD is also an important resource which standardizes the rules of inference used by software to validate the feature structure markup in a text','and to infer the full interpretation of underspecified feature structures.The reader should be aware the terminology used in this document does not always closely follow conventional practice in formal logic','and may also diverge from practice in some linguistic applications of typed feature structures. In particular','the term interpretation when applied to a feature structure is not an interpretation in the model-theoretic sense','but is instead a minimally informative (or equivalently','most general) extension of that feature structure that is consistent with a set of constraints declared by an FSD. In linguistic application','such a system of constraints is the principal means by which the grammar of some natural language is expressed. There is a great deal of disagreement as to what','if any','model-theoretic interpretation feature structures have in such applications','but the status of this formal kind of interpretation is not germane to the present document. Similarly','the term valid is used here as elsewhere in these Guidelines to identify the syntactic state of well-formedness in the sense defined by the logic of typed feature structures itself','as distinct from and in addition to the well-formedness that pertains at the level of this encoding standard.

For this reason','the TEI schema supports a variety of different approaches to solving similar problems','and also defines a much richer set of elements than is likely to be necessary in any given project. Furthermore','the TEI schema may be extended in well-defined and documented ways for texts that cannot be conveniently or appropriately encoded using what is provided. For these reasons','it is almost impossible to use the TEI schema without customizing it in some way. This section describes how the TEI encoding schema may be customized','and should be read in conjunction with chapter TD (Documentation Elements) ','which describes how a specific application of the TEI encoding schema should be documented. The documentation system described in that chapter is','like the rest of the TEI schema','independent of any particular schema or document type definition language. Formally speaking','these Guidelines provide both syntactic rules about how elements and attributes may be used in valid documents and semantic recommendations about what interpretation should be attached to a given syntactic construct. In this sense','they provide both a document type definition and a document type declaration. More exactly','we may distinguish between the TEI Abstract Model','which defines a set of related concepts','and the TEI schema which defines a set of syntactic rules and constraints. Many (though not all) of the semantic recommendations are provided solely as informal descriptive prose','though some of them are also enforced by means of such constructs as datatypes (see DTYPES (Datatype Specifications) )','or by schema constraints expressed using the Schematron language. Schematron constraints provide information about special kinds of validation errors dependent on conditional relationships','such as the invalidity of an attribute name or value on one element when another is present','or when','given a pair of attributes such as minOccurs and maxOccurs','the minimum value exceeds the maximum value. Schematron constraints also provide warnings when a particular element','attribute','or combination is to be deprecated in future releases of the TEI scheme','to alert users that the feature in question is no longer to be used after a certain date. Very rarely','TEI Schematron constraints offer warnings that do not explicitly break with the TEI but suggest a more efficient or less ambiguous encoding. Although the descriptions','validation errors','and warnings have been written with care','there will inevitably be cases where the intention of the contributors has not been conveyed with sufficient clarity to prevent users of these Guidelines from extending them in the sense of attaching slightly variant semantics to them. Beyond this unintentional semantic extension','some of the elements described can intentionally be used in a variety of ways; for example','the element note has an attribute type which can take on arbitrary string values','depending on how it is used in a document. A new type of note','therefore','requires no change in the existing model. On the other hand','for many applications','it may be desirable to constrain the possible values for the type attribute to a small set of possibilities. A schema modified in this way would no longer necessarily regard as valid the same set of documents as the corresponding unmodified TEI schema','but would remain faithful to the same conceptual model.This section explains how the TEI schema can be customized by suppressing elements','modifying classes of elements','or adding elements. Documents which validate against an application of the TEI schema which has been customized in this way may or may not be considered TEI-conformant','as further discussed in section CF (Conformance) .The TEI system is designed to support modification and customization in a documented way that can be validated by an XML processor. This is achieved by writing a small TEI-conformant document','known informally as an ODD (One Document Does it all)','from which an appropriate processor can generate both human-readable documentation','and a schema expressed in a language such as RELAX NG or DTD. The mechanisms used to instantiate a TEI schema differ for different schema languages','and are therefore not defined here. In XML DTDs','for example','extensive use is made of parameter entities','while in RELAX NG schemas','extensive use is made of patterns. In either case','the names of elements and','wherever possible','their attributes and content models are defined indirectly. The syntax used to implement this indirection also varies with the schema language used','but the underlying constructs in the TEI Abstract Model are given the same names. This indirection makes it simpler to implement customization of the TEI system in an accessible and human-readable way. As further discussed in section ST (The TEI Infrastructure) ','the TEI encoding schema comprises a set of class and macro declarations','and a number of modules. Each module is made up of element and attribute declarations','and a schema is made by combining a particular set of modules together. In the absence of any other kind of customization','when modules are combined together: all the elements defined by the module (and described in the corresponding section of these Guidelines) are included in the schema; each such element is identified by the canonical name given it in these Guidelines; the content model of each such element is as defined by these Guidelines; the names','datatypes','and permitted values declared for each attribute associated with each such element are as given in these Guidelines; the elements comprising element classes and the meaning of macro declarations expressed in terms of element classes is determined by the particular combination of modules selected. The TEI customization mechanisms allow the user to control this behaviour as follows: particular elements may be suppressed','removing them from any classes in which they are members','and also from any generated schema; new elements may be added to an existing class','thus making them available in macros or content models defined in terms of those classes; additional attributes','or attribute values','may be specified for an individual element or for classes of elements; within certain limits','attributes','or attribute values','may also be removed either from an individual element or for classes of elements; the characteristics inherited by one class from another class may be modified by modifying its class membership: all members of the class then inherit the changed characteristics; the set of values legal for an attribute or attribute class may be constrained or relaxed by supplying or modifying a value list','or by modifying its datatype. within certain limits','the name (generic identifier) associated with an element may be changed','without changing the semantic or syntactic properties of the element; The modification mechanisms presented in this section are quite general','and may be used to make all the types of changes just listed. The recommended way of implementing and documenting all such modifications is by means of the ODD system described in chapter TD (Documentation Elements) ; in the remainder of this section we give specific examples to illustrate how that system may be applied. An ODD processor','such as the Roma application supported by the TEI','or any other comparable set of stylesheets will use the declarations provided by an ODD to generate appropriate sets of declarations in a specific schema language such as RELAX NG or the XML DTD language. We do not discuss in detail here how this should be done','since the details are schema language-specific; some background information about the methods used for XML DTD and RELAX NG schema generation is however provided in section STIN (Defining a TEI Schema) . Several example ODD files are also provided as part of the standard TEI release: see further section MDlite (Examples of Modification) below.']",,,,,,,,

This is particularly the case when the rules being defined relate to texts that already exist: the designer may have only the haziest of notions as to an ancient text's original purpose or meaning and hence find it very difficult to specify consistent rules about its structure. On the other hand','where a new text is being prepared to an exact specification','for entry into a textual database of some kind for example','the more precisely stated the rules','the better they can be enforced. Even in marking up an existing text','a restrictive set of schema rules may be beneficial','especially when applied to test a particular view or hypothesis about the text. A schema designed for use by a small project or team is likely to take a different position on such issues than one intended for use by a large and possibly fragmented community. It is important to remember that every schema results from an interpretation of a text. There is no single schema encompassing the absolute truth about any text','although it may be convenient to privilege some schemas above others for particular types of analysis.XML is widely used in environments where uniformity of document structure is a major desideratum. In the production of technical documentation','for example','it is of major importance that sections and subsections should be properly nested','that cross-references should be properly resolved and so forth. In such situations','documents are seen as raw material to match against predefined sets of rules. As discussed above','however','the use of simple rules can also greatly simplify the task of tagging accurately elements of less rigidly constrained texts. By making these schema rules explicit','scholars reduce their own burdens with consistently marking up and verifying the electronic text. By defining and sharing their schema rules','scholars openly express a project-specific interpretation of the structure and significant particularities of the text being encoded.Schema validation for XML is usually written in the RELAX NG language ( () ) originally developed within the OASIS Technical Committee and now an ISO standard ISO/IEC FDIS 19757-2 Document Schema Definition Language (DSDL) — Part 2: Regular-grammar-based validation — RELAX NG ','though other older methods include the Document Type Definition (DTD) language which XML inherited from SGML and the XML Schema language ( () ) defined by the W3C.Schema validation languages co-evolved with early markup language specifications','as summarized in Rick Jelliffe's Family Tree of Schema Languages for Markup Languages. In this chapter','and throughout these Guidelines','we give examples using the compact syntax of RELAX NG for ease of reading. The specifications for the TEI Guidelines are first expressed in the TEI language itself and a RELAX NG schema is generated from them for processing convenience. Details about schema customization using the TEI ODD language are addressed in TD (Documentation Elements) ','MD (Customization) and IM (Implementation of an ODD System) .']",,,,,,,,

Local systems may allow their schema to be implicit','but for interchange purposes the schema associated with a document must be made explicit. The method of doing this recommended by these Guidelines is to provide explicitly or by reference a TEI schema specification against which the document may be validated.A TEI-conformant schema is a specific combination of TEI modules','possibly also including additional declarations that modify the element and attribute declarations contained by each module','for example to suppress or rename some elements. The TEI provides an application-independent way of specifying a TEI schema by means of the schemaSpec element defined in chapter TD (Documentation Elements) .

The standard allows these characters to be represented either directly','using an appropriate encoding (UTF-8 by default)','or indirectly by means of a numeric character reference (NCR)','such as &amp;#196; (A-umlaut). The encoder can also restrict the range of characters which are represented directly in a document (or part of it) by adding a suitable encoding declaration. For example','if a document begins with the declaration &lt;?xml encoding='iso-8859-1'?&gt; any Unicode characters which are not in the ISO-8859-1 character set must be represented by NCRs. The gaiji module defined by this chapter adds a further way of representing specific characters and glyphs in a document. (Gaiji is from Japanese 外字','meaning external characters.) This allows the encoder to distinguish characters and glyphs which Unicode regards as identical','to add new nonstandard characters or glyphs','and to represent Unicode characters not available in the document encoding by an alternative means.The mechanism provided here consists functionally of two parts: an element g','which serves as a proxy for new characters or glyphs elements char and glyph','providing information about such characters or glyphs; these elements are stored in the charDecl element in the header. When the gaiji module is included in a schema','the charDecl element is added to the model.encodingDescPart class','and the g element is added to the phrase class. These elements and their components are documented in the rest of this section. The Unicode standard defines properties for all the characters it defines in the Unicode Character Database ','knowledge of which is usually built into text processing systems. If the character represented by the g element does not exist in Unicode at all','its properties are not available. If the character represented is an existing Unicode character','but is not available in the document character set recognized by a given text processing system','it may also be convenient to have access to its properties in the same way. The char element makes it possible to store properties for use by such applications in a standard way. The list of attributes (properties) for characters is modelled on those in the Unicode Character Database','which distinguishes normative and informative character properties. The Unicode Consortium also maintains a separate set of character properties specific to East Asian characters in the Unihan database which TEI fully supports. Lastly','non-Unicode properties may also be supplied. Since the list of properties will vary with different versions of the Unicode Standard','there may not be an exact correspondence between them and the list of properties defined in these Guidelines.Usage examples for these elements are given below at D25-30 (Annotating Characters) and D25-40 (Adding New Characters) . The gaiji module itself is formally defined in section WSD-DEF (Formal Definition) below. It declares the following additional elements: The charDecl element is a member of the class model.encodingDescPart','and thus becomes available within encodingDesc when this module is included in a schema. The g element is the only member of the class model.gLike: this class is referenced as an alternative to plain text in almost every element which contains plain text','thus permitting the g element also to appear at such places when this module is included in a schema. The following elements may appear within a charDecl element: The char and glyph elements have similar contents and are used in similar ways','but their functions are different. The char element is provided to define a character which is not available in the current document character set','for whatever reason','as stated above. The glyph element is used to annotate a character that has already been defined somewhere (either in the document character set','or through a char element) by providing a specific glyph that shows how a character appeared in the original document. This is necessary since Unicode code points refer not to a single','specific glyph shape of a character','but rather to a set of glyphs','any of which may be used to render the code point in question; in some cases they can differ considerably.The glyph element is provided for cases where the encoder wants to specify a specific glyph (or family of glyphs) out of all possible glyphs. Unfortunately','due to the way Unicode has been defined','there are cases where several glyphs that logically belong together have been given separate code points','especially in the blocks defining East Asian characters. In such cases','glyph elements can also be used to express the view that these apparently distinct characters are to be regarded as instances of the same character (see further D25-30 (Annotating Characters) ).The Unicode Standard recommends naming conventions which should be followed strictly where the intention is to annotate an existing Unicode character','and which may also be used as a model when creating new names for characters or glyphsIt should be noted','however','that this naming convention cannot meaningfully be applied to East Asian characters; the typical Unicode descriptions for these characters take the form CJK Unified Ideograph U+4E00 ','where U+4E00 is simply the Unicode code point value of the character in question. In cases where no Unicode code point exists','there is little hope of finding a name that helps to identify the character. Names should therefore be constructed in a way meaningful to local practice','for example by using a reference number from a well-known character dictionary or a project-specific serial number.:Within both char and glyph','the following elements are available: Four of these elements (gloss','desc','figure','and note) are defined by other TEI modules','and their usage here is no different from their usage elsewhere. The figure element','however','is used here only to link to an image of the character or glyph under discussion','or to contain a representation of it in SVG. The figure element may contain more than one graphic element','for example to provide images with different resolution','or in different formats','or may itself be repeated. As elsewhere','the mimeType attribute of graphic should be used to specify the format of the image.The mapping element is similar to the standard TEI equiv element. While the latter is used to express correspondence relationships between TEI concepts or elements and those in other systems or ontologies','the former is used to express any kind of relationship between the character or glyph under discussion and characters or glyphs defined elsewhere. It may contain any Unicode character','or a g element linked to some other char or glyph element','if','for example','the intention is to express an association between two non-standard characters. The type of association is indicated by the type attribute','which may take such values as exact for exact equivalences','uppercase for uppercase equivalences','lowercase for lowercase equivalences','standard for standardized forms','and simplified for simplified characters','etc.','as in the following example: a The mapping element may also be used to represent a mapping of the character or (more likely) glyph under discussion onto a character from the private use area as in this example: Z U+E304 A more precise documentation of the properties of any character or glyph may be supplied using one of the three property elements: localProp','unicodeProp','or unihanProp; these are described in the next section.']",,,,,,,,

They are required at several points within the TEI header's source description','as discussed in section HD3 (The Source Description) ; they may also appear within the body of a text','either singly (for example within a footnote)','or collected together in a list as a distinct part of a text; detailed bibliographic descriptions of manuscript or other source materials may also be required. These Guidelines propose a number of specialized elements to encode such descriptions','which together constitute the model.biblLike class. Lists of such elements may also be encoded using the following element: In printed texts','the individual constituents of a bibliographic reference are conventionally marked off from each other and from the flow of text by such features as bracketing','italics','special punctuation conventions','underlining','etc. In electronic texts','such distinctions are also important','whether in order to produce acceptably formatted output or to facilitate intelligent retrieval processing','For example','to distinguish London as an author's name from London as a place of publication or as a component of a title. quite apart from the need to distinguish the reference itself as a textual object with particular linguistic properties. It should be emphasized that for references as for other textual features','the primary or sole consideration is not how the text should be formatted when it is printed or displayed. The distinctions permitted by the scheme outlined here may not necessarily be all that particular formatters or bibliographic styles require','although they should prove adequate to the needs of many such commonly used software systems.Among the bibliographic software systems and subsystems consulted in the design of the biblStruct structure were BibTeX','Scribe','and ProCite. The distinctions made by all three may be preserved in biblStruct structures','though the nature of their design prevents a simple one-to-one mapping from their data elements to TEI elements. For further information','see section COBIOT (Relationship to Other Bibliographic Schemes) . The features distinguished and described below (in section COBICO (Components of Bibliographic References) ) constitute a set which has been useful for a wide range of bibliographic purposes and in many applications','and which moreover corresponds to a great extent with existing bibliographic and library cataloguing practice. For a fuller account of that practice as applied to electronic texts see section HD3 (The Source Description) ; for a brief mention of related library standards see section HD8 (Note for Library Cataloguers) . The most commonly used elements in the model.biblLike class are biblStruct and bibl. biblStruct will usually be easier to process mechanically than bibl because its structure is more constrained and predictable. It is suited to situations in which the objective is to represent bibliographic information for machine processing directly by other systems or after conversion to some other bibliographic markup formats such as BibTeXML or MODS. Punctuation delimiting the components of a print citation is not permitted directly within a biblStruct element; instead','the presence and order of child elements must be used to reconstruct the punctuation required by a particular style. By contrast','bibl allows for considerable flexibility in that it can include both delimiting punctuation and unmarked-up text; and its constituents can also be ordered in any way. This makes it suitable for marking up bibliographies in existing documents','where it is considered important to preserve the form of references in the original document','while also distinguishing important pieces of information such as authors','dates','publishers','and so on. bibl may also be useful when encoding born digital documents which require use of a specific style guide when rendering the content; its flexibility makes it easier to provide all the information for a reference in the exact sequence required by the target rendering','including any necessary punctuation and linking words','rather than using an XSLT stylesheet or similar to reorder and punctuate the data. The third element in the model.biblLike class','biblFull','has a content model based on the fileDesc element of the TEI header. Both are based on the International Standard for Bibliographic Description (ISBD)','which forms the basis of several national standards for bibliographic citations. The order of child elements in both biblFull and fileDesc corresponds to the order of bibliographic description areas in ISBD with two minor exceptions. First','the extent element','corresponding to the physical description area in ISBD','appears just after the publication','production','distribution','etc. area in ISBD','not before it as in TEI. Second','biblFull and fileDesc use the child element publicationStmt to cover not only the publication','production','distribution','etc. area but also the resource identifier and terms of availability area associated with that publication. Despite these inconsistencies','users encoding citations and attempting to format them according to a standard that closely adheres to ISBD may find that biblFull','used with its child elements and without delimiting punctuation','provides an appropriate granularity of encoding with elements that can easily be rendered for the reader. However','it is important to note that some ISBD-derived citation formats (such as ANSI/NISO Z39.29 and ГОСТ 7.1) are not entirely conformant to ISBD either','since they may begin with a statement of authorship that does not map to the ISBD statement of responsibility.']",,,,

Most manuscript descriptions touch on several of these categories of information though few include them all','and not all distinguish them as clearly as we propose here. In particular','it is often the case that an existing description will include information for which we propose distinct elements within a single paragraph','or even sentence. The encoder must then decide whether to rewrite the description using the structure proposed here','or to retain the existing prose','marked up simply as a series of p elements','directly within the physDesc element.The physDesc element may thus be used in either of two distinct ways. It may contain a series of paragraphs addressing topics listed above and similar ones. Alternatively','it may act as a container for any choice of the more specialized elements described in the remainder of this section','each of which itself contains a series of paragraphs','and may also have more specific attributes. In general','it is not recommended to combine unstructured prose description with usage of the more specialized elements','as such an approach complicates processing','and may lead to inconsistency within a single manuscript description. A single physDesc element will normally contain either a series of model.pLike elements','or a sequence of specialized elements from the model.physDescPart class. There are however circumstances in which this is not feasible','for example: the description already exists in a prose form where some of the specialized topics are treated together in paragraphs of prose','but others are treated distinctly; although all parts of the description are clearly distinguished','some of them cannot be mapped to a pre-existing specialized element.

By contrast','a well formed XML document is not required to specify a schema at all. Nonetheless','it may well be useful to indicate that the element names used in it have some defined provenance. It might also be desirable to include in a document elements that are defined (possibly differently) in different schemas. A cabinet-maker's schema might well define an element called table with very different characteristics from those of a documentalist's.The concept of namespace was introduced into the XML language as a means of addressing these and related problems. If the markup of an XML document is thought of as an expression in some language','then a namespace may be thought of as analogous to the lexicon of that language. Just as a document can contain words taken from different languages','so a well-formed XML document can include elements taken from different namespaces. A namespace resembles a schema in that we may say that a given set of elements belongs to a given namespace','or are defined by a given schema. However','a schema is a set of element definitions','whereas a namespace is really only a property of a collection of elements: the only tangible form it takes in an XML document is its distinctive prefix and the identifying name associated with it.Suppose for example that we wish to extend our anthology to include a complex diagram. We might start by considering whether or not to extend our simple schema to include XML markup for such features as arcs','polygons','and other graphical elements. XML can be used to represent any kind of structure','not simply text','and there are clear advantages to having our text and our diagrams all expressed in the same way.Fortunately we do not need to invent a schema for the representation of graphical components such as diagrams; it already exists in the shape of the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) language defined by the W3C.The W3C Recommendation is defined at () . SVG is a widely used and rich XML vocabulary for representing all kinds of two-dimensional graphics; it is also well supported by existing software. Using an SVG-aware drawing package','we can easily draw our diagram and save it in XML format for inclusion within our anthology. When we do so','we need to indicate that this part of the document contains elements taken from the SVG namespace','if only to ensure that processing software does not confuse our line element with the SVG line','which means something quite different. An XML document need not specify any namespace: it is then said to use the null namespace. Alternatively','the root element of a document may supply a default namespace','understood to apply to all elements which have no namespace prefix. This is the function of the xmlns attribute which provides a unique name for the default namespace','in the form of a URI: In exactly the same way','on the root element for each part of our document which uses the SVG language','we might introduce the SVG namespace name: Although a namespace name usually uses the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) syntax','it is not treated as an online address and an XML processor regards it just as a string','providing a longer name for the namespace.The xmlns attribute can also be used to associate a short prefix name with the namespace it defines. This is very useful if we want to mingle elements from different namespaces within the same document','since the prefix can be attached to any element','overriding the implicit namespace for itself (but not its children): There is no limit on the number of namespaces that a document can use. Provided that each is uniquely identified','an XML processor can identify those that are relevant','and validate them appropriately. To extend our example further','we might decide to add a linguistic analysis to each of the poems','using a set of elements such as aux','adj','etc.','derived from some pre-existing XML vocabulary for linguistic analysis. O Rose thou art sick']","['SG-er']","Unpack BIB cites here","nf:specPuller() coming here","['In addition to the elements and attributes so far discussed','an XML document can contain a few other formally distinct things. An XML document may contain references to predefined strings of data that a validator must resolve before attempting to validate the document's structure; these are called entity references. They may be useful as a means of providing boilerplate text or representing character data which cannot easily be keyboarded. As noted earlier','an XML document may also contain instances of elements taken from some other namespace. And an XML document may also contain arbitrary signals or flags for use when the document is processed in a particular way by some class of processor (a common example in document production is the need to force a formatter to start a new page at some specific point in a document); such flags are called processing instructions. We discuss each of these three cases in the rest of this section.The XML declaration should be supplied at the very beginning of every XML file; while it looks like a processing instruction','it is not','and may not occur anywhere other than at the very beginning of an XML file. For example: &lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt; The XML declaration specifies the version number of the XML Recommendation applicable to the document it introduces (in this case','version 1.0)','and optionally also the character encoding used to represent the Unicode characters within it. By default an XML document uses the character encoding UTF-8 or UTF-16; other commonly-encountered encodings include ISO 8859-1. If any character present in the document is not available in the specified character encoding','it must be represented as a character reference (SG-er (Character References) ). The XML declaration is documentary','but should normally be supplied at the start of any XML file. If it is missing many XML-aware processors will be unable to process the associated text correctly.']",,,,

One or more listPerson elements may be supplied within the standOff element (see SASOstdf (The standOff Container) ) or','when used to list the participants in a linguistic interaction','within the particDesc (participant description) element in the profileDesc element of a TEI header.

As a member of the classes att.global.responsibility','att.editLike','and att.global.source class','it carries the usual attributes for providing details about the information recorded for that person','such as its reliability or source: In addition','a small number of very commonly used personal properties may be recorded using attributes specific to person and personGrp: These attributes are intended for use where only a small amount of data is to be encoded in a more or less normalized form','possibly for many person elements','for example when encoding basic facts about respondents to a questionnaire. When however a more detailed encoding is required for all kinds of information about a person','for example in a historical gazetteer','then it will be more appropriate to use the elements age','sex and others described elsewhere in this chapter.Note that the age attribute is not intended to record the person's age expressed in years','months','or other temporal unit. Rather it is intended to record into which age bracket','for the purposes of some analysis','the person falls. A simple (perhaps too simple to be useful) binary classification of age brackets would be child and adult. The actual age brackets useful to various projects are likely to be varied and idiosyncratic','and thus these Guidelines make no particular recommendation as to possible values. Instead','individual projects are recommended to define the values they use in their own customization file','using a declaration like the following: less than 18 years of age 18 to 65 years of age over 65 years of age The above declaration','were it properly placed in a customization file','establishes that the age attribute of person has only three possible values','child','adult','and retired. For more information on customization see MD (Customization) .The person element may contain many sub-elements','each specifying a different property of the person being described. The remainder of this section describes these more specific elements. For convenience','these elements are grouped into three classes','corresponding with the tripartite division outlined above: one for traits','one for states and one for events. Each class may contain specific elements for common types of biographical information','and contains a generic element for other','user-defined','types of information.All the elements in these three classes belong to the attribute class att.datable','which provides the following attributes: as discussed in NDATTS (Attribute Classes Defined by This Module) above.']",,,,

By contrast','a well formed XML document is not required to specify a schema at all. Nonetheless','it may well be useful to indicate that the element names used in it have some defined provenance. It might also be desirable to include in a document elements that are defined (possibly differently) in different schemas. A cabinet-maker's schema might well define an element called table with very different characteristics from those of a documentalist's.The concept of namespace was introduced into the XML language as a means of addressing these and related problems. If the markup of an XML document is thought of as an expression in some language','then a namespace may be thought of as analogous to the lexicon of that language. Just as a document can contain words taken from different languages','so a well-formed XML document can include elements taken from different namespaces. A namespace resembles a schema in that we may say that a given set of elements belongs to a given namespace','or are defined by a given schema. However','a schema is a set of element definitions','whereas a namespace is really only a property of a collection of elements: the only tangible form it takes in an XML document is its distinctive prefix and the identifying name associated with it.Suppose for example that we wish to extend our anthology to include a complex diagram. We might start by considering whether or not to extend our simple schema to include XML markup for such features as arcs','polygons','and other graphical elements. XML can be used to represent any kind of structure','not simply text','and there are clear advantages to having our text and our diagrams all expressed in the same way.Fortunately we do not need to invent a schema for the representation of graphical components such as diagrams; it already exists in the shape of the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) language defined by the W3C.The W3C Recommendation is defined at () . SVG is a widely used and rich XML vocabulary for representing all kinds of two-dimensional graphics; it is also well supported by existing software. Using an SVG-aware drawing package','we can easily draw our diagram and save it in XML format for inclusion within our anthology. When we do so','we need to indicate that this part of the document contains elements taken from the SVG namespace','if only to ensure that processing software does not confuse our line element with the SVG line','which means something quite different. An XML document need not specify any namespace: it is then said to use the null namespace. Alternatively','the root element of a document may supply a default namespace','understood to apply to all elements which have no namespace prefix. This is the function of the xmlns attribute which provides a unique name for the default namespace','in the form of a URI: In exactly the same way','on the root element for each part of our document which uses the SVG language','we might introduce the SVG namespace name: Although a namespace name usually uses the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) syntax','it is not treated as an online address and an XML processor regards it just as a string','providing a longer name for the namespace.The xmlns attribute can also be used to associate a short prefix name with the namespace it defines. This is very useful if we want to mingle elements from different namespaces within the same document','since the prefix can be attached to any element','overriding the implicit namespace for itself (but not its children): There is no limit on the number of namespaces that a document can use. Provided that each is uniquely identified','an XML processor can identify those that are relevant','and validate them appropriately. To extend our example further','we might decide to add a linguistic analysis to each of the poems','using a set of elements such as aux','adj','etc.','derived from some pre-existing XML vocabulary for linguistic analysis.

(a) the typographic view—the two-dimensional printed page','including information about lineation','pagination','and other features of layout (b) the editorial view—the one-dimensional sequence of tokens which can be seen as the input to the typesetting process; the wording and punctuation of the text and the sequencing of items are visible in this view','but specifics of the typographic realization are not (c) the lexical view—this view includes the underlying information represented in a dictionary','without concern for its exact textual form For example','a domain indication in a dictionary entry might be broken over a line and therefore hyphenated (naut- ical); the typographic view of the dictionary preserves this information. In a purely editorial view','the particular form in which the domain name is given in the particular dictionary (as nautical','rather than naut.','Naut.','etc.) would be preserved','but the fact that the word was split across two lines with a soft hyphen would not. Font shifts might plausibly be included in either a strictly typographic or an editorial view. In the lexical view','the only information preserved concerning domain would be some standard symbol or string representing the nautical domain (e.g. naut.) regardless of the form in which it appears in the printed dictionary. In practice','publishers begin with the lexical view—i.e.','lexical data as it might appear in a database—and generate first the editorial view','which reflects editorial choices for a particular dictionary (such as the use of the abbreviation Naut. for nautical','the fonts in which different types of information are to be rendered','etc.)','and then the typographic view','which is tied to a specific printed rendering. Computational linguists and philologists often begin with the typographic view and analyse it to obtain the editorial and/or lexical views. Some users may ultimately be concerned with retaining only the lexical view','or they may wish to preserve the typographic or editorial views as a reference text','perhaps as a guard against the loss or misinterpretation of information in the translation process. Some researchers may wish to retain all three views','and study their interrelations','since research questions may well span all three views. In general','an electronic encoding of a text will allow the recovery of at least one view of that text (the one which guided the encoding); if editorial and typographic practices are consistently applied in the production of a printed dictionary','or if exceptions to the rules are consistently recorded in the electronic encoding','then it is in principle possible to recover the editorial view from an encoding of the lexical view','and the typographic view from an encoding of the editorial view. In practice','of course','the severe compression of information in dictionaries','the variety of methods by which this compression is achieved','the complexity of formulating completely explicit rules for editorial and typographic practice','and the relative rarity of complete consistency in the application of such rules','all make the mechanical transformation of information from one view into another something of a vexed question.

A balance must be struck between the convenience of following simple rules and the complexity of handling real texts. This is particularly the case when the rules being defined relate to texts that already exist: the designer may have only the haziest of notions as to an ancient text's original purpose or meaning and hence find it very difficult to specify consistent rules about its structure. On the other hand','where a new text is being prepared to an exact specification','for entry into a textual database of some kind for example','the more precisely stated the rules','the better they can be enforced. Even in marking up an existing text','a restrictive set of schema rules may be beneficial','especially when applied to test a particular view or hypothesis about the text. A schema designed for use by a small project or team is likely to take a different position on such issues than one intended for use by a large and possibly fragmented community. It is important to remember that every schema results from an interpretation of a text. There is no single schema encompassing the absolute truth about any text','although it may be convenient to privilege some schemas above others for particular types of analysis.XML is widely used in environments where uniformity of document structure is a major desideratum. In the production of technical documentation','for example','it is of major importance that sections and subsections should be properly nested','that cross-references should be properly resolved and so forth. In such situations','documents are seen as raw material to match against predefined sets of rules. As discussed above','however','the use of simple rules can also greatly simplify the task of tagging accurately elements of less rigidly constrained texts. By making these schema rules explicit','scholars reduce their own burdens with consistently marking up and verifying the electronic text. By defining and sharing their schema rules','scholars openly express a project-specific interpretation of the structure and significant particularities of the text being encoded.Schema validation for XML is usually written in the RELAX NG language ( () ) originally developed within the OASIS Technical Committee and now an ISO standard ISO/IEC FDIS 19757-2 Document Schema Definition Language (DSDL) — Part 2: Regular-grammar-based validation — RELAX NG ','though other older methods include the Document Type Definition (DTD) language which XML inherited from SGML and the XML Schema language ( () ) defined by the W3C.Schema validation languages co-evolved with early markup language specifications','as summarized in Rick Jelliffe's Family Tree of Schema Languages for Markup Languages. In this chapter','and throughout these Guidelines','we give examples using the compact syntax of RELAX NG for ease of reading.

These Guidelines propose a number of specialized elements to encode such descriptions','which together constitute the model.biblLike class. Lists of such elements may also be encoded using the following element: In printed texts','the individual constituents of a bibliographic reference are conventionally marked off from each other and from the flow of text by such features as bracketing','italics','special punctuation conventions','underlining','etc. In electronic texts','such distinctions are also important','whether in order to produce acceptably formatted output or to facilitate intelligent retrieval processing','For example','to distinguish London as an author's name from London as a place of publication or as a component of a title. quite apart from the need to distinguish the reference itself as a textual object with particular linguistic properties. It should be emphasized that for references as for other textual features','the primary or sole consideration is not how the text should be formatted when it is printed or displayed. The distinctions permitted by the scheme outlined here may not necessarily be all that particular formatters or bibliographic styles require','although they should prove adequate to the needs of many such commonly used software systems.Among the bibliographic software systems and subsystems consulted in the design of the biblStruct structure were BibTeX','Scribe','and ProCite. The distinctions made by all three may be preserved in biblStruct structures','though the nature of their design prevents a simple one-to-one mapping from their data elements to TEI elements. For further information','see section COBIOT (Relationship to Other Bibliographic Schemes) . The features distinguished and described below (in section COBICO (Components of Bibliographic References) ) constitute a set which has been useful for a wide range of bibliographic purposes and in many applications','and which moreover corresponds to a great extent with existing bibliographic and library cataloguing practice. For a fuller account of that practice as applied to electronic texts see section HD3 (The Source Description) ; for a brief mention of related library standards see section HD8 (Note for Library Cataloguers) . The most commonly used elements in the model.biblLike class are biblStruct and bibl. biblStruct will usually be easier to process mechanically than bibl because its structure is more constrained and predictable. It is suited to situations in which the objective is to represent bibliographic information for machine processing directly by other systems or after conversion to some other bibliographic markup formats such as BibTeXML or MODS. Punctuation delimiting the components of a print citation is not permitted directly within a biblStruct element; instead','the presence and order of child elements must be used to reconstruct the punctuation required by a particular style. By contrast','bibl allows for considerable flexibility in that it can include both delimiting punctuation and unmarked-up text; and its constituents can also be ordered in any way. This makes it suitable for marking up bibliographies in existing documents','where it is considered important to preserve the form of references in the original document','while also distinguishing important pieces of information such as authors','dates','publishers','and so on. bibl may also be useful when encoding born digital documents which require use of a specific style guide when rendering the content; its flexibility makes it easier to provide all the information for a reference in the exact sequence required by the target rendering','including any necessary punctuation and linking words','rather than using an XSLT stylesheet or similar to reorder and punctuate the data. The third element in the model.biblLike class','biblFull','has a content model based on the fileDesc element of the TEI header. Both are based on the International Standard for Bibliographic Description (ISBD)','which forms the basis of several national standards for bibliographic citations. The order of child elements in both biblFull and fileDesc corresponds to the order of bibliographic description areas in ISBD with two minor exceptions. First','the extent element','corresponding to the physical description area in ISBD','appears just after the publication','production','distribution','etc. area in ISBD','not before it as in TEI. Second','biblFull and fileDesc use the child element publicationStmt to cover not only the publication','production','distribution','etc. area but also the resource identifier and terms of availability area associated with that publication. Despite these inconsistencies','users encoding citations and attempting to format them according to a standard that closely adheres to ISBD may find that biblFull','used with its child elements and without delimiting punctuation','provides an appropriate granularity of encoding with elements that can easily be rendered for the reader. However','it is important to note that some ISBD-derived citation formats (such as ANSI/NISO Z39.29 and ГОСТ 7.1) are not entirely conformant to ISBD either','since they may begin with a statement of authorship that does not map to the ISBD statement of responsibility.']","['COBI','HD8','HD21','HD27']","Unpack BIB cites here","nf:specPuller() coming here","['This section describes the fileDesc element','which is the first component of the teiHeader element.The bibliographic description of a machine-readable or digital text resembles in structure that of a book','an article','or any other kind of textual object.

The FSD serves three purposes: the encoder can list all of the feature names and feature values and give a prose description as to what each represents. the encoder can define what it means to be a well-formed feature structure','and define constraints which may be used to determine whether a particular feature structure is valid relative to a given theory stated in typed feature logic. These may involve constraints on the range of a feature value','constraints on what features are valid within certain types of feature structures','or constraints that prevent the co-occurrence of certain feature-value pairs. the encoder can define the intended interpretation of underspecified feature structures. This involves defining default values (whether literal or computed) for missing features. The scheme described in this chapter may be used to document any feature structure system','but is primarily intended for use with the feature structure representation defined by the ISO 24610-1:2006 standard','which corresponds with the recommendations presented in these Guidelines','FS (Feature Structures) . This chapter relies upon','but does not reproduce','formal definitions and descriptions presented more thoroughly in the ISO standard','which should be consulted in case of ambiguity or uncertainty. The FSD serves an important function in documenting precisely what the encoder intended by the system of feature structure markup used in an XML-encoded text. The FSD is also an important resource which standardizes the rules of inference used by software to validate the feature structure markup in a text','and to infer the full interpretation of underspecified feature structures.The reader should be aware the terminology used in this document does not always closely follow conventional practice in formal logic','and may also diverge from practice in some linguistic applications of typed feature structures. In particular','the term interpretation when applied to a feature structure is not an interpretation in the model-theoretic sense','but is instead a minimally informative (or equivalently','most general) extension of that feature structure that is consistent with a set of constraints declared by an FSD. In linguistic application','such a system of constraints is the principal means by which the grammar of some natural language is expressed.

For this reason','the TEI schema supports a variety of different approaches to solving similar problems','and also defines a much richer set of elements than is likely to be necessary in any given project. Furthermore','the TEI schema may be extended in well-defined and documented ways for texts that cannot be conveniently or appropriately encoded using what is provided. For these reasons','it is almost impossible to use the TEI schema without customizing it in some way. This section describes how the TEI encoding schema may be customized','and should be read in conjunction with chapter TD (Documentation Elements) ','which describes how a specific application of the TEI encoding schema should be documented. The documentation system described in that chapter is','like the rest of the TEI schema','independent of any particular schema or document type definition language. Formally speaking','these Guidelines provide both syntactic rules about how elements and attributes may be used in valid documents and semantic recommendations about what interpretation should be attached to a given syntactic construct. In this sense','they provide both a document type definition and a document type declaration. More exactly','we may distinguish between the TEI Abstract Model','which defines a set of related concepts','and the TEI schema which defines a set of syntactic rules and constraints. Many (though not all) of the semantic recommendations are provided solely as informal descriptive prose','though some of them are also enforced by means of such constructs as datatypes (see DTYPES (Datatype Specifications) )','or by schema constraints expressed using the Schematron language. Schematron constraints provide information about special kinds of validation errors dependent on conditional relationships','such as the invalidity of an attribute name or value on one element when another is present','or when','given a pair of attributes such as minOccurs and maxOccurs','the minimum value exceeds the maximum value. Schematron constraints also provide warnings when a particular element','attribute','or combination is to be deprecated in future releases of the TEI scheme','to alert users that the feature in question is no longer to be used after a certain date. Very rarely','TEI Schematron constraints offer warnings that do not explicitly break with the TEI but suggest a more efficient or less ambiguous encoding. Although the descriptions','validation errors','and warnings have been written with care','there will inevitably be cases where the intention of the contributors has not been conveyed with sufficient clarity to prevent users of these Guidelines from extending them in the sense of attaching slightly variant semantics to them. Beyond this unintentional semantic extension','some of the elements described can intentionally be used in a variety of ways; for example','the element note has an attribute type which can take on arbitrary string values','depending on how it is used in a document. A new type of note','therefore','requires no change in the existing model. On the other hand','for many applications','it may be desirable to constrain the possible values for the type attribute to a small set of possibilities. A schema modified in this way would no longer necessarily regard as valid the same set of documents as the corresponding unmodified TEI schema','but would remain faithful to the same conceptual model.This section explains how the TEI schema can be customized by suppressing elements','modifying classes of elements','or adding elements. Documents which validate against an application of the TEI schema which has been customized in this way may or may not be considered TEI-conformant','as further discussed in section CF (Conformance) .The TEI system is designed to support modification and customization in a documented way that can be validated by an XML processor. This is achieved by writing a small TEI-conformant document','known informally as an ODD (One Document Does it all)','from which an appropriate processor can generate both human-readable documentation','and a schema expressed in a language such as RELAX NG or DTD. The mechanisms used to instantiate a TEI schema differ for different schema languages','and are therefore not defined here. In XML DTDs','for example','extensive use is made of parameter entities','while in RELAX NG schemas','extensive use is made of patterns. In either case','the names of elements and','wherever possible','their attributes and content models are defined indirectly. The syntax used to implement this indirection also varies with the schema language used','but the underlying constructs in the TEI Abstract Model are given the same names. This indirection makes it simpler to implement customization of the TEI system in an accessible and human-readable way. As further discussed in section ST (The TEI Infrastructure) ','the TEI encoding schema comprises a set of class and macro declarations','and a number of modules. Each module is made up of element and attribute declarations','and a schema is made by combining a particular set of modules together. In the absence of any other kind of customization','when modules are combined together: all the elements defined by the module (and described in the corresponding section of these Guidelines) are included in the schema; each such element is identified by the canonical name given it in these Guidelines; the content model of each such element is as defined by these Guidelines; the names','datatypes','and permitted values declared for each attribute associated with each such element are as given in these Guidelines; the elements comprising element classes and the meaning of macro declarations expressed in terms of element classes is determined by the particular combination of modules selected. The TEI customization mechanisms allow the user to control this behaviour as follows: particular elements may be suppressed','removing them from any classes in which they are members','and also from any generated schema; new elements may be added to an existing class','thus making them available in macros or content models defined in terms of those classes; additional attributes','or attribute values','may be specified for an individual element or for classes of elements; within certain limits','attributes','or attribute values','may also be removed either from an individual element or for classes of elements; the characteristics inherited by one class from another class may be modified by modifying its class membership: all members of the class then inherit the changed characteristics; the set of values legal for an attribute or attribute class may be constrained or relaxed by supplying or modifying a value list','or by modifying its datatype. within certain limits','the name (generic identifier) associated with an element may be changed','without changing the semantic or syntactic properties of the element; The modification mechanisms presented in this section are quite general','and may be used to make all the types of changes just listed. The recommended way of implementing and documenting all such modifications is by means of the ODD system described in chapter TD (Documentation Elements) ; in the remainder of this section we give specific examples to illustrate how that system may be applied. An ODD processor','such as the Roma application supported by the TEI','or any other comparable set of stylesheets will use the declarations provided by an ODD to generate appropriate sets of declarations in a specific schema language such as RELAX NG or the XML DTD language. We do not discuss in detail here how this should be done','since the details are schema language-specific; some background information about the methods used for XML DTD and RELAX NG schema generation is however provided in section STIN (Defining a TEI Schema) . Several example ODD files are also provided as part of the standard TEI release: see further section MDlite (Examples of Modification) below.']",,,,

Most manuscript descriptions touch on several of these categories of information though few include them all','and not all distinguish them as clearly as we propose here. In particular','it is often the case that an existing description will include information for which we propose distinct elements within a single paragraph','or even sentence. The encoder must then decide whether to rewrite the description using the structure proposed here','or to retain the existing prose','marked up simply as a series of p elements','directly within the physDesc element.The physDesc element may thus be used in either of two distinct ways. It may contain a series of paragraphs addressing topics listed above and similar ones. Alternatively','it may act as a container for any choice of the more specialized elements described in the remainder of this section','each of which itself contains a series of paragraphs','and may also have more specific attributes. In general','it is not recommended to combine unstructured prose description with usage of the more specialized elements','as such an approach complicates processing','and may lead to inconsistency within a single manuscript description. A single physDesc element will normally contain either a series of model.pLike elements','or a sequence of specialized elements from the model.physDescPart class. There are however circumstances in which this is not feasible','for example: the description already exists in a prose form where some of the specialized topics are treated together in paragraphs of prose','but others are treated distinctly; although all parts of the description are clearly distinguished','some of them cannot be mapped to a pre-existing specialized element. In such situations','both specialized and generic (model.pLike) elements may be combined in a single physDesc. Note however that all generic elements given must precede the first specialized element in the description. Thus the following is valid: Generic descriptive prose... but neither of the following is valid: &lt;physDesc&gt; &lt;objectDesc form='codex'&gt; &lt;!-- ... --&gt; &lt;/objectDesc&gt; &lt;p&gt;Generic descriptive prose...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/physDesc&gt; &lt;physDesc&gt; &lt;objectDesc form='codex'&gt; &lt;!-- ... --&gt; &lt;/objectDesc&gt; &lt;p&gt;Generic descriptive prose...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- other specific elements here --&gt; &lt;/physDesc&gt; The order in which specific elements may appear is also constrained by the content model; again this is for simplicity of processing.

Attributes are useful in precisely such circumstances.Although different elements may have attributes with the same name (for example','in the TEI scheme','every element is defined as having an attribute named n)','they are always regarded as different','and may have different values assigned to them.

When however a more detailed encoding is required for all kinds of information about a person','for example in a historical gazetteer','then it will be more appropriate to use the elements age','sex and others described elsewhere in this chapter.Note that the age attribute is not intended to record the person's age expressed in years','months','or other temporal unit. Rather it is intended to record into which age bracket','for the purposes of some analysis','the person falls. A simple (perhaps too simple to be useful) binary classification of age brackets would be child and adult. The actual age brackets useful to various projects are likely to be varied and idiosyncratic','and thus these Guidelines make no particular recommendation as to possible values. Instead','individual projects are recommended to define the values they use in their own customization file','using a declaration like the following: less than 18 years of age 18 to 65 years of age over 65 years of age The above declaration','were it properly placed in a customization file','establishes that the age attribute of person has only three possible values','child','adult','and retired. For more information on customization see MD (Customization) .The person element may contain many sub-elements','each specifying a different property of the person being described. The remainder of this section describes these more specific elements. For convenience','these elements are grouped into three classes','corresponding with the tripartite division outlined above: one for traits','one for states and one for events. Each class may contain specific elements for common types of biographical information','and contains a generic element for other','user-defined','types of information.All the elements in these three classes belong to the attribute class att.datable','which provides the following attributes: as discussed in NDATTS (Attribute Classes Defined by This Module) above.']",,,,

(a) the typographic view—the two-dimensional printed page','including information about lineation','pagination','and other features of layout (b) the editorial view—the one-dimensional sequence of tokens which can be seen as the input to the typesetting process; the wording and punctuation of the text and the sequencing of items are visible in this view','but specifics of the typographic realization are not (c) the lexical view—this view includes the underlying information represented in a dictionary','without concern for its exact textual form For example','a domain indication in a dictionary entry might be broken over a line and therefore hyphenated (naut- ical); the typographic view of the dictionary preserves this information. In a purely editorial view','the particular form in which the domain name is given in the particular dictionary (as nautical','rather than naut.','Naut.','etc.) would be preserved','but the fact that the word was split across two lines with a soft hyphen would not. Font shifts might plausibly be included in either a strictly typographic or an editorial view. In the lexical view','the only information preserved concerning domain would be some standard symbol or string representing the nautical domain (e.g. naut.) regardless of the form in which it appears in the printed dictionary. In practice','publishers begin with the lexical view—i.e.','lexical data as it might appear in a database—and generate first the editorial view','which reflects editorial choices for a particular dictionary (such as the use of the abbreviation Naut. for nautical','the fonts in which different types of information are to be rendered','etc.)','and then the typographic view','which is tied to a specific printed rendering. Computational linguists and philologists often begin with the typographic view and analyse it to obtain the editorial and/or lexical views. Some users may ultimately be concerned with retaining only the lexical view','or they may wish to preserve the typographic or editorial views as a reference text','perhaps as a guard against the loss or misinterpretation of information in the translation process. Some researchers may wish to retain all three views','and study their interrelations','since research questions may well span all three views. In general','an electronic encoding of a text will allow the recovery of at least one view of that text (the one which guided the encoding); if editorial and typographic practices are consistently applied in the production of a printed dictionary','or if exceptions to the rules are consistently recorded in the electronic encoding','then it is in principle possible to recover the editorial view from an encoding of the lexical view','and the typographic view from an encoding of the editorial view. In practice','of course','the severe compression of information in dictionaries','the variety of methods by which this compression is achieved','the complexity of formulating completely explicit rules for editorial and typographic practice','and the relative rarity of complete consistency in the application of such rules','all make the mechanical transformation of information from one view into another something of a vexed question.

For this reason','the TEI schema supports a variety of different approaches to solving similar problems','and also defines a much richer set of elements than is likely to be necessary in any given project. Furthermore','the TEI schema may be extended in well-defined and documented ways for texts that cannot be conveniently or appropriately encoded using what is provided. For these reasons','it is almost impossible to use the TEI schema without customizing it in some way. This section describes how the TEI encoding schema may be customized','and should be read in conjunction with chapter TD (Documentation Elements) ','which describes how a specific application of the TEI encoding schema should be documented. The documentation system described in that chapter is','like the rest of the TEI schema','independent of any particular schema or document type definition language. Formally speaking','these Guidelines provide both syntactic rules about how elements and attributes may be used in valid documents and semantic recommendations about what interpretation should be attached to a given syntactic construct. In this sense','they provide both a document type definition and a document type declaration. More exactly','we may distinguish between the TEI Abstract Model','which defines a set of related concepts','and the TEI schema which defines a set of syntactic rules and constraints. Many (though not all) of the semantic recommendations are provided solely as informal descriptive prose','though some of them are also enforced by means of such constructs as datatypes (see DTYPES (Datatype Specifications) )','or by schema constraints expressed using the Schematron language. Schematron constraints provide information about special kinds of validation errors dependent on conditional relationships','such as the invalidity of an attribute name or value on one element when another is present','or when','given a pair of attributes such as minOccurs and maxOccurs','the minimum value exceeds the maximum value. Schematron constraints also provide warnings when a particular element','attribute','or combination is to be deprecated in future releases of the TEI scheme','to alert users that the feature in question is no longer to be used after a certain date. Very rarely','TEI Schematron constraints offer warnings that do not explicitly break with the TEI but suggest a more efficient or less ambiguous encoding. Although the descriptions','validation errors','and warnings have been written with care','there will inevitably be cases where the intention of the contributors has not been conveyed with sufficient clarity to prevent users of these Guidelines from extending them in the sense of attaching slightly variant semantics to them. Beyond this unintentional semantic extension','some of the elements described can intentionally be used in a variety of ways; for example','the element note has an attribute type which can take on arbitrary string values','depending on how it is used in a document. A new type of note','therefore','requires no change in the existing model. On the other hand','for many applications','it may be desirable to constrain the possible values for the type attribute to a small set of possibilities. A schema modified in this way would no longer necessarily regard as valid the same set of documents as the corresponding unmodified TEI schema','but would remain faithful to the same conceptual model.This section explains how the TEI schema can be customized by suppressing elements','modifying classes of elements','or adding elements. Documents which validate against an application of the TEI schema which has been customized in this way may or may not be considered TEI-conformant','as further discussed in section CF (Conformance) .The TEI system is designed to support modification and customization in a documented way that can be validated by an XML processor. This is achieved by writing a small TEI-conformant document','known informally as an ODD (One Document Does it all)','from which an appropriate processor can generate both human-readable documentation','and a schema expressed in a language such as RELAX NG or DTD. The mechanisms used to instantiate a TEI schema differ for different schema languages','and are therefore not defined here. In XML DTDs','for example','extensive use is made of parameter entities','while in RELAX NG schemas','extensive use is made of patterns. In either case','the names of elements and','wherever possible','their attributes and content models are defined indirectly. The syntax used to implement this indirection also varies with the schema language used','but the underlying constructs in the TEI Abstract Model are given the same names. This indirection makes it simpler to implement customization of the TEI system in an accessible and human-readable way. As further discussed in section ST (The TEI Infrastructure) ','the TEI encoding schema comprises a set of class and macro declarations','and a number of modules. Each module is made up of element and attribute declarations','and a schema is made by combining a particular set of modules together. In the absence of any other kind of customization','when modules are combined together: all the elements defined by the module (and described in the corresponding section of these Guidelines) are included in the schema; each such element is identified by the canonical name given it in these Guidelines; the content model of each such element is as defined by these Guidelines; the names','datatypes','and permitted values declared for each attribute associated with each such element are as given in these Guidelines; the elements comprising element classes and the meaning of macro declarations expressed in terms of element classes is determined by the particular combination of modules selected. The TEI customization mechanisms allow the user to control this behaviour as follows: particular elements may be suppressed','removing them from any classes in which they are members','and also from any generated schema; new elements may be added to an existing class','thus making them available in macros or content models defined in terms of those classes; additional attributes','or attribute values','may be specified for an individual element or for classes of elements; within certain limits','attributes','or attribute values','may also be removed either from an individual element or for classes of elements; the characteristics inherited by one class from another class may be modified by modifying its class membership: all members of the class then inherit the changed characteristics; the set of values legal for an attribute or attribute class may be constrained or relaxed by supplying or modifying a value list','or by modifying its datatype. within certain limits','the name (generic identifier) associated with an element may be changed','without changing the semantic or syntactic properties of the element; The modification mechanisms presented in this section are quite general','and may be used to make all the types of changes just listed. The recommended way of implementing and documenting all such modifications is by means of the ODD system described in chapter TD (Documentation Elements) ; in the remainder of this section we give specific examples to illustrate how that system may be applied. An ODD processor','such as the Roma application supported by the TEI','or any other comparable set of stylesheets will use the declarations provided by an ODD to generate appropriate sets of declarations in a specific schema language such as RELAX NG or the XML DTD language. We do not discuss in detail here how this should be done','since the details are schema language-specific; some background information about the methods used for XML DTD and RELAX NG schema generation is however provided in section STIN (Defining a TEI Schema) . Several example ODD files are also provided as part of the standard TEI release: see further section MDlite (Examples of Modification) below.']","['','','TD','MD','IM']","Unpack BIB cites here","nf:specPuller() coming here","['The design of a schema may be as lax or as restrictive as the occasion warrants. A balance must be struck between the convenience of following simple rules and the complexity of handling real texts. This is particularly the case when the rules being defined relate to texts that already exist: the designer may have only the haziest of notions as to an ancient text's original purpose or meaning and hence find it very difficult to specify consistent rules about its structure. On the other hand','where a new text is being prepared to an exact specification','for entry into a textual database of some kind for example','the more precisely stated the rules','the better they can be enforced. Even in marking up an existing text','a restrictive set of schema rules may be beneficial','especially when applied to test a particular view or hypothesis about the text. A schema designed for use by a small project or team is likely to take a different position on such issues than one intended for use by a large and possibly fragmented community. It is important to remember that every schema results from an interpretation of a text. There is no single schema encompassing the absolute truth about any text','although it may be convenient to privilege some schemas above others for particular types of analysis.XML is widely used in environments where uniformity of document structure is a major desideratum. In the production of technical documentation','for example','it is of major importance that sections and subsections should be properly nested','that cross-references should be properly resolved and so forth. In such situations','documents are seen as raw material to match against predefined sets of rules. As discussed above','however','the use of simple rules can also greatly simplify the task of tagging accurately elements of less rigidly constrained texts. By making these schema rules explicit','scholars reduce their own burdens with consistently marking up and verifying the electronic text. By defining and sharing their schema rules','scholars openly express a project-specific interpretation of the structure and significant particularities of the text being encoded.Schema validation for XML is usually written in the RELAX NG language ( () ) originally developed within the OASIS Technical Committee and now an ISO standard ISO/IEC FDIS 19757-2 Document Schema Definition Language (DSDL) — Part 2: Regular-grammar-based validation — RELAX NG ','though other older methods include the Document Type Definition (DTD) language which XML inherited from SGML and the XML Schema language ( () ) defined by the W3C.Schema validation languages co-evolved with early markup language specifications','as summarized in Rick Jelliffe's Family Tree of Schema Languages for Markup Languages. In this chapter','and throughout these Guidelines','we give examples using the compact syntax of RELAX NG for ease of reading. The specifications for the TEI Guidelines are first expressed in the TEI language itself and a RELAX NG schema is generated from them for processing convenience.

The same system may also be used to specify a schema which extends the TEI by adding new elements explicitly','or by reference to other XML vocabularies. In either case','the specification may be processed to generate a formal schema','expressed in a variety of specific schema languages','such as XML DTD language','RELAX NG','or W3C Schema. These output schemas can then be used by an XML processor such as a validator or editor to validate or otherwise process documents. Further information about the processing of a TEI formal specification is given in chapter USE (Using the TEI) .']",,,,

It may be found useful in such situations as: interchange or integration of documents amongst different researchers or users; software specifications for TEI-aware processing tools; agreements for the deposit of texts in','and distribution of texts from','archives; specifying the form of documents to be produced by or for a given project. It is not intended to provide any other evaluation','for example of scholarly merit','intellectual integrity','or value for money. A document may be of major intellectual importance and yet not be TEI-conformant; a TEI-conformant document may be of no scholarly value whatsoever.In this section we explore several aspects of conformance','and in particular attempt to define how the term TEI-conformant should be used. The terminology defined here should be considered normative: users and implementors of the TEI Guidelines should use the phrases TEI-conformant and TEI Extension only in the senses given and with the usages described. A document is TEI-conformant if it: is a well-formed XML document (CFWF (Well-formedness Criterion) ) can be validated against a TEI Schema','that is','a schema derived from the TEI Guidelines (CFVL (Validation Constraint) ) conforms to the TEI Abstract Model (CFAM (Conformance to the TEI Abstract Model) ) uses the TEI namespace (and other namespaces where relevant) correctly (CFNS (Use of the TEI Namespace) ) is documented by means of a TEI-conformant ODD file (CFOD (Documentation Constraint) ) which refers to the TEI Guidelines Each of these criteria is discussed in more detail below. A document is said to use a TEI Extension if it is a well-formed XML document which is valid against a TEI Schema which contains additional distinctions','representing concepts not present in the TEI Abstract Model','and therefore not documented in these Guidelines. Such a document cannot necessarily be transformed automatically to a TEI-conformant document without loss of information. However','since one of the goals of the TEI is to support extensions and modifications','it should not be assumed that no TEI document can include extensions: an extension which is expressed by means of the recommended mechanisms is also a TEI-conformant document provided that those parts of it which are not extensions are TEI-conformant.A TEI-conformant document is said to follow TEI Recommended Practice if','wherever these Guidelines prefer one encoding practice to another','the preferred practice is used.']","['TD','DTYPES','CF','ST','TD','STIN','MDlite']","Unpack BIB cites here","nf:specPuller() coming here","['These Guidelines provide an encoding schema suitable for encoding a very wide range of texts','and capable of supporting a wide variety of applications. For this reason','the TEI schema supports a variety of different approaches to solving similar problems','and also defines a much richer set of elements than is likely to be necessary in any given project. Furthermore','the TEI schema may be extended in well-defined and documented ways for texts that cannot be conveniently or appropriately encoded using what is provided. For these reasons','it is almost impossible to use the TEI schema without customizing it in some way. This section describes how the TEI encoding schema may be customized','and should be read in conjunction with chapter TD (Documentation Elements) ','which describes how a specific application of the TEI encoding schema should be documented. The documentation system described in that chapter is','like the rest of the TEI schema','independent of any particular schema or document type definition language. Formally speaking','these Guidelines provide both syntactic rules about how elements and attributes may be used in valid documents and semantic recommendations about what interpretation should be attached to a given syntactic construct. In this sense','they provide both a document type definition and a document type declaration. More exactly','we may distinguish between the TEI Abstract Model','which defines a set of related concepts','and the TEI schema which defines a set of syntactic rules and constraints. Many (though not all) of the semantic recommendations are provided solely as informal descriptive prose','though some of them are also enforced by means of such constructs as datatypes (see DTYPES (Datatype Specifications) )','or by schema constraints expressed using the Schematron language. Schematron constraints provide information about special kinds of validation errors dependent on conditional relationships','such as the invalidity of an attribute name or value on one element when another is present','or when','given a pair of attributes such as minOccurs and maxOccurs','the minimum value exceeds the maximum value. Schematron constraints also provide warnings when a particular element','attribute','or combination is to be deprecated in future releases of the TEI scheme','to alert users that the feature in question is no longer to be used after a certain date. Very rarely','TEI Schematron constraints offer warnings that do not explicitly break with the TEI but suggest a more efficient or less ambiguous encoding. Although the descriptions','validation errors','and warnings have been written with care','there will inevitably be cases where the intention of the contributors has not been conveyed with sufficient clarity to prevent users of these Guidelines from extending them in the sense of attaching slightly variant semantics to them. Beyond this unintentional semantic extension','some of the elements described can intentionally be used in a variety of ways; for example','the element note has an attribute type which can take on arbitrary string values','depending on how it is used in a document. A new type of note','therefore','requires no change in the existing model. On the other hand','for many applications','it may be desirable to constrain the possible values for the type attribute to a small set of possibilities. A schema modified in this way would no longer necessarily regard as valid the same set of documents as the corresponding unmodified TEI schema','but would remain faithful to the same conceptual model.This section explains how the TEI schema can be customized by suppressing elements','modifying classes of elements','or adding elements. Documents which validate against an application of the TEI schema which has been customized in this way may or may not be considered TEI-conformant','as further discussed in section CF (Conformance) .The TEI system is designed to support modification and customization in a documented way that can be validated by an XML processor. This is achieved by writing a small TEI-conformant document','known informally as an ODD (One Document Does it all)','from which an appropriate processor can generate both human-readable documentation','and a schema expressed in a language such as RELAX NG or DTD. The mechanisms used to instantiate a TEI schema differ for different schema languages','and are therefore not defined here. In XML DTDs','for example','extensive use is made of parameter entities','while in RELAX NG schemas','extensive use is made of patterns. In either case','the names of elements and','wherever possible','their attributes and content models are defined indirectly. The syntax used to implement this indirection also varies with the schema language used','but the underlying constructs in the TEI Abstract Model are given the same names. This indirection makes it simpler to implement customization of the TEI system in an accessible and human-readable way. As further discussed in section ST (The TEI Infrastructure) ','the TEI encoding schema comprises a set of class and macro declarations','and a number of modules. Each module is made up of element and attribute declarations','and a schema is made by combining a particular set of modules together. In the absence of any other kind of customization','when modules are combined together: all the elements defined by the module (and described in the corresponding section of these Guidelines) are included in the schema; each such element is identified by the canonical name given it in these Guidelines; the content model of each such element is as defined by these Guidelines; the names','datatypes','and permitted values declared for each attribute associated with each such element are as given in these Guidelines; the elements comprising element classes and the meaning of macro declarations expressed in terms of element classes is determined by the particular combination of modules selected. The TEI customization mechanisms allow the user to control this behaviour as follows: particular elements may be suppressed','removing them from any classes in which they are members','and also from any generated schema; new elements may be added to an existing class','thus making them available in macros or content models defined in terms of those classes; additional attributes','or attribute values','may be specified for an individual element or for classes of elements; within certain limits','attributes','or attribute values','may also be removed either from an individual element or for classes of elements; the characteristics inherited by one class from another class may be modified by modifying its class membership: all members of the class then inherit the changed characteristics; the set of values legal for an attribute or attribute class may be constrained or relaxed by supplying or modifying a value list','or by modifying its datatype. within certain limits','the name (generic identifier) associated with an element may be changed','without changing the semantic or syntactic properties of the element; The modification mechanisms presented in this section are quite general','and may be used to make all the types of changes just listed. The recommended way of implementing and documenting all such modifications is by means of the ODD system described in chapter TD (Documentation Elements) ; in the remainder of this section we give specific examples to illustrate how that system may be applied. An ODD processor','such as the Roma application supported by the TEI','or any other comparable set of stylesheets will use the declarations provided by an ODD to generate appropriate sets of declarations in a specific schema language such as RELAX NG or the XML DTD language. We do not discuss in detail here how this should be done','since the details are schema language-specific; some background information about the methods used for XML DTD and RELAX NG schema generation is however provided in section STIN (Defining a TEI Schema) . Several example ODD files are also provided as part of the standard TEI release: see further section MDlite (Examples of Modification) below.']",,,,

(a) the typographic view—the two-dimensional printed page','including information about lineation','pagination','and other features of layout (b) the editorial view—the one-dimensional sequence of tokens which can be seen as the input to the typesetting process; the wording and punctuation of the text and the sequencing of items are visible in this view','but specifics of the typographic realization are not (c) the lexical view—this view includes the underlying information represented in a dictionary','without concern for its exact textual form For example','a domain indication in a dictionary entry might be broken over a line and therefore hyphenated (naut- ical); the typographic view of the dictionary preserves this information. In a purely editorial view','the particular form in which the domain name is given in the particular dictionary (as nautical','rather than naut.','Naut.','etc.) would be preserved','but the fact that the word was split across two lines with a soft hyphen would not. Font shifts might plausibly be included in either a strictly typographic or an editorial view. In the lexical view','the only information preserved concerning domain would be some standard symbol or string representing the nautical domain (e.g. naut.) regardless of the form in which it appears in the printed dictionary. In practice','publishers begin with the lexical view—i.e.','lexical data as it might appear in a database—and generate first the editorial view','which reflects editorial choices for a particular dictionary (such as the use of the abbreviation Naut. for nautical','the fonts in which different types of information are to be rendered','etc.)','and then the typographic view','which is tied to a specific printed rendering. Computational linguists and philologists often begin with the typographic view and analyse it to obtain the editorial and/or lexical views. Some users may ultimately be concerned with retaining only the lexical view','or they may wish to preserve the typographic or editorial views as a reference text','perhaps as a guard against the loss or misinterpretation of information in the translation process. Some researchers may wish to retain all three views','and study their interrelations','since research questions may well span all three views. In general','an electronic encoding of a text will allow the recovery of at least one view of that text (the one which guided the encoding); if editorial and typographic practices are consistently applied in the production of a printed dictionary','or if exceptions to the rules are consistently recorded in the electronic encoding','then it is in principle possible to recover the editorial view from an encoding of the lexical view','and the typographic view from an encoding of the editorial view. In practice','of course','the severe compression of information in dictionaries','the variety of methods by which this compression is achieved','the complexity of formulating completely explicit rules for editorial and typographic practice','and the relative rarity of complete consistency in the application of such rules','all make the mechanical transformation of information from one view into another something of a vexed question. This section describes some principles which may be useful in capturing one or the other of these views as consistently and completely as possible','and describes some methods of attempting to capture more than one view in a single encoding. Only the editorial and lexical views are explicitly treated here; for methods of recording the physical or typographic details of a text','see chapter PH (Representation of Primary Sources) .

In practice','publishers begin with the lexical view—i.e.','lexical data as it might appear in a database—and generate first the editorial view','which reflects editorial choices for a particular dictionary (such as the use of the abbreviation Naut. for nautical','the fonts in which different types of information are to be rendered','etc.)','and then the typographic view','which is tied to a specific printed rendering.

Some researchers may wish to retain all three views','and study their interrelations','since research questions may well span all three views. In general','an electronic encoding of a text will allow the recovery of at least one view of that text (the one which guided the encoding); if editorial and typographic practices are consistently applied in the production of a printed dictionary','or if exceptions to the rules are consistently recorded in the electronic encoding','then it is in principle possible to recover the editorial view from an encoding of the lexical view','and the typographic view from an encoding of the editorial view. In practice','of course','the severe compression of information in dictionaries','the variety of methods by which this compression is achieved','the complexity of formulating completely explicit rules for editorial and typographic practice','and the relative rarity of complete consistency in the application of such rules','all make the mechanical transformation of information from one view into another something of a vexed question. This section describes some principles which may be useful in capturing one or the other of these views as consistently and completely as possible','and describes some methods of attempting to capture more than one view in a single encoding. Only the editorial and lexical views are explicitly treated here; for methods of recording the physical or typographic details of a text','see chapter PH (Representation of Primary Sources) . Other approaches to these problems','such as the use of repetitive encoding and links to show their correspondences','or the use of feature structures to capture the information structure','and of the ana and inst attributes to link feature structures to a transcription of the editorial view of a dictionary','are not discussed here (for feature structures','see chapter FS (Feature Structures) .

For this reason','the TEI schema supports a variety of different approaches to solving similar problems','and also defines a much richer set of elements than is likely to be necessary in any given project. Furthermore','the TEI schema may be extended in well-defined and documented ways for texts that cannot be conveniently or appropriately encoded using what is provided. For these reasons','it is almost impossible to use the TEI schema without customizing it in some way. This section describes how the TEI encoding schema may be customized','and should be read in conjunction with chapter TD (Documentation Elements) ','which describes how a specific application of the TEI encoding schema should be documented. The documentation system described in that chapter is','like the rest of the TEI schema','independent of any particular schema or document type definition language. Formally speaking','these Guidelines provide both syntactic rules about how elements and attributes may be used in valid documents and semantic recommendations about what interpretation should be attached to a given syntactic construct. In this sense','they provide both a document type definition and a document type declaration. More exactly','we may distinguish between the TEI Abstract Model','which defines a set of related concepts','and the TEI schema which defines a set of syntactic rules and constraints. Many (though not all) of the semantic recommendations are provided solely as informal descriptive prose','though some of them are also enforced by means of such constructs as datatypes (see DTYPES (Datatype Specifications) )','or by schema constraints expressed using the Schematron language. Schematron constraints provide information about special kinds of validation errors dependent on conditional relationships','such as the invalidity of an attribute name or value on one element when another is present','or when','given a pair of attributes such as minOccurs and maxOccurs','the minimum value exceeds the maximum value. Schematron constraints also provide warnings when a particular element','attribute','or combination is to be deprecated in future releases of the TEI scheme','to alert users that the feature in question is no longer to be used after a certain date. Very rarely','TEI Schematron constraints offer warnings that do not explicitly break with the TEI but suggest a more efficient or less ambiguous encoding. Although the descriptions','validation errors','and warnings have been written with care','there will inevitably be cases where the intention of the contributors has not been conveyed with sufficient clarity to prevent users of these Guidelines from extending them in the sense of attaching slightly variant semantics to them. Beyond this unintentional semantic extension','some of the elements described can intentionally be used in a variety of ways; for example','the element note has an attribute type which can take on arbitrary string values','depending on how it is used in a document. A new type of note','therefore','requires no change in the existing model. On the other hand','for many applications','it may be desirable to constrain the possible values for the type attribute to a small set of possibilities. A schema modified in this way would no longer necessarily regard as valid the same set of documents as the corresponding unmodified TEI schema','but would remain faithful to the same conceptual model.This section explains how the TEI schema can be customized by suppressing elements','modifying classes of elements','or adding elements. Documents which validate against an application of the TEI schema which has been customized in this way may or may not be considered TEI-conformant','as further discussed in section CF (Conformance) .The TEI system is designed to support modification and customization in a documented way that can be validated by an XML processor. This is achieved by writing a small TEI-conformant document','known informally as an ODD (One Document Does it all)','from which an appropriate processor can generate both human-readable documentation','and a schema expressed in a language such as RELAX NG or DTD. The mechanisms used to instantiate a TEI schema differ for different schema languages','and are therefore not defined here. In XML DTDs','for example','extensive use is made of parameter entities','while in RELAX NG schemas','extensive use is made of patterns. In either case','the names of elements and','wherever possible','their attributes and content models are defined indirectly. The syntax used to implement this indirection also varies with the schema language used','but the underlying constructs in the TEI Abstract Model are given the same names. This indirection makes it simpler to implement customization of the TEI system in an accessible and human-readable way. As further discussed in section ST (The TEI Infrastructure) ','the TEI encoding schema comprises a set of class and macro declarations','and a number of modules. Each module is made up of element and attribute declarations','and a schema is made by combining a particular set of modules together. In the absence of any other kind of customization','when modules are combined together: all the elements defined by the module (and described in the corresponding section of these Guidelines) are included in the schema; each such element is identified by the canonical name given it in these Guidelines; the content model of each such element is as defined by these Guidelines; the names','datatypes','and permitted values declared for each attribute associated with each such element are as given in these Guidelines; the elements comprising element classes and the meaning of macro declarations expressed in terms of element classes is determined by the particular combination of modules selected. The TEI customization mechanisms allow the user to control this behaviour as follows: particular elements may be suppressed','removing them from any classes in which they are members','and also from any generated schema; new elements may be added to an existing class','thus making them available in macros or content models defined in terms of those classes; additional attributes','or attribute values','may be specified for an individual element or for classes of elements; within certain limits','attributes','or attribute values','may also be removed either from an individual element or for classes of elements; the characteristics inherited by one class from another class may be modified by modifying its class membership: all members of the class then inherit the changed characteristics; the set of values legal for an attribute or attribute class may be constrained or relaxed by supplying or modifying a value list','or by modifying its datatype. within certain limits','the name (generic identifier) associated with an element may be changed','without changing the semantic or syntactic properties of the element; The modification mechanisms presented in this section are quite general','and may be used to make all the types of changes just listed. The recommended way of implementing and documenting all such modifications is by means of the ODD system described in chapter TD (Documentation Elements) ; in the remainder of this section we give specific examples to illustrate how that system may be applied. An ODD processor','such as the Roma application supported by the TEI','or any other comparable set of stylesheets will use the declarations provided by an ODD to generate appropriate sets of declarations in a specific schema language such as RELAX NG or the XML DTD language. We do not discuss in detail here how this should be done','since the details are schema language-specific; some background information about the methods used for XML DTD and RELAX NG schema generation is however provided in section STIN (Defining a TEI Schema) . Several example ODD files are also provided as part of the standard TEI release: see further section MDlite (Examples of Modification) below.']",,,,

These Guidelines propose a number of specialized elements to encode such descriptions','which together constitute the model.biblLike class. Lists of such elements may also be encoded using the following element: In printed texts','the individual constituents of a bibliographic reference are conventionally marked off from each other and from the flow of text by such features as bracketing','italics','special punctuation conventions','underlining','etc. In electronic texts','such distinctions are also important','whether in order to produce acceptably formatted output or to facilitate intelligent retrieval processing','For example','to distinguish London as an author's name from London as a place of publication or as a component of a title. quite apart from the need to distinguish the reference itself as a textual object with particular linguistic properties. It should be emphasized that for references as for other textual features','the primary or sole consideration is not how the text should be formatted when it is printed or displayed. The distinctions permitted by the scheme outlined here may not necessarily be all that particular formatters or bibliographic styles require','although they should prove adequate to the needs of many such commonly used software systems.Among the bibliographic software systems and subsystems consulted in the design of the biblStruct structure were BibTeX','Scribe','and ProCite. The distinctions made by all three may be preserved in biblStruct structures','though the nature of their design prevents a simple one-to-one mapping from their data elements to TEI elements. For further information','see section COBIOT (Relationship to Other Bibliographic Schemes) . The features distinguished and described below (in section COBICO (Components of Bibliographic References) ) constitute a set which has been useful for a wide range of bibliographic purposes and in many applications','and which moreover corresponds to a great extent with existing bibliographic and library cataloguing practice. For a fuller account of that practice as applied to electronic texts see section HD3 (The Source Description) ; for a brief mention of related library standards see section HD8 (Note for Library Cataloguers) . The most commonly used elements in the model.biblLike class are biblStruct and bibl. biblStruct will usually be easier to process mechanically than bibl because its structure is more constrained and predictable. It is suited to situations in which the objective is to represent bibliographic information for machine processing directly by other systems or after conversion to some other bibliographic markup formats such as BibTeXML or MODS. Punctuation delimiting the components of a print citation is not permitted directly within a biblStruct element; instead','the presence and order of child elements must be used to reconstruct the punctuation required by a particular style. By contrast','bibl allows for considerable flexibility in that it can include both delimiting punctuation and unmarked-up text; and its constituents can also be ordered in any way. This makes it suitable for marking up bibliographies in existing documents','where it is considered important to preserve the form of references in the original document','while also distinguishing important pieces of information such as authors','dates','publishers','and so on. bibl may also be useful when encoding born digital documents which require use of a specific style guide when rendering the content; its flexibility makes it easier to provide all the information for a reference in the exact sequence required by the target rendering','including any necessary punctuation and linking words','rather than using an XSLT stylesheet or similar to reorder and punctuate the data. The third element in the model.biblLike class','biblFull','has a content model based on the fileDesc element of the TEI header. Both are based on the International Standard for Bibliographic Description (ISBD)','which forms the basis of several national standards for bibliographic citations. The order of child elements in both biblFull and fileDesc corresponds to the order of bibliographic description areas in ISBD with two minor exceptions. First','the extent element','corresponding to the physical description area in ISBD','appears just after the publication','production','distribution','etc. area in ISBD','not before it as in TEI. Second','biblFull and fileDesc use the child element publicationStmt to cover not only the publication','production','distribution','etc. area but also the resource identifier and terms of availability area associated with that publication. Despite these inconsistencies','users encoding citations and attempting to format them according to a standard that closely adheres to ISBD may find that biblFull','used with its child elements and without delimiting punctuation','provides an appropriate granularity of encoding with elements that can easily be rendered for the reader. However','it is important to note that some ISBD-derived citation formats (such as ANSI/NISO Z39.29 and ГОСТ 7.1) are not entirely conformant to ISBD either','since they may begin with a statement of authorship that does not map to the ISBD statement of responsibility.']",,,,,,,,

For this reason','the TEI schema supports a variety of different approaches to solving similar problems','and also defines a much richer set of elements than is likely to be necessary in any given project. Furthermore','the TEI schema may be extended in well-defined and documented ways for texts that cannot be conveniently or appropriately encoded using what is provided. For these reasons','it is almost impossible to use the TEI schema without customizing it in some way. This section describes how the TEI encoding schema may be customized','and should be read in conjunction with chapter TD (Documentation Elements) ','which describes how a specific application of the TEI encoding schema should be documented. The documentation system described in that chapter is','like the rest of the TEI schema','independent of any particular schema or document type definition language. Formally speaking','these Guidelines provide both syntactic rules about how elements and attributes may be used in valid documents and semantic recommendations about what interpretation should be attached to a given syntactic construct. In this sense','they provide both a document type definition and a document type declaration. More exactly','we may distinguish between the TEI Abstract Model','which defines a set of related concepts','and the TEI schema which defines a set of syntactic rules and constraints. Many (though not all) of the semantic recommendations are provided solely as informal descriptive prose','though some of them are also enforced by means of such constructs as datatypes (see DTYPES (Datatype Specifications) )','or by schema constraints expressed using the Schematron language. Schematron constraints provide information about special kinds of validation errors dependent on conditional relationships','such as the invalidity of an attribute name or value on one element when another is present','or when','given a pair of attributes such as minOccurs and maxOccurs','the minimum value exceeds the maximum value. Schematron constraints also provide warnings when a particular element','attribute','or combination is to be deprecated in future releases of the TEI scheme','to alert users that the feature in question is no longer to be used after a certain date. Very rarely','TEI Schematron constraints offer warnings that do not explicitly break with the TEI but suggest a more efficient or less ambiguous encoding. Although the descriptions','validation errors','and warnings have been written with care','there will inevitably be cases where the intention of the contributors has not been conveyed with sufficient clarity to prevent users of these Guidelines from extending them in the sense of attaching slightly variant semantics to them. Beyond this unintentional semantic extension','some of the elements described can intentionally be used in a variety of ways; for example','the element note has an attribute type which can take on arbitrary string values','depending on how it is used in a document. A new type of note','therefore','requires no change in the existing model. On the other hand','for many applications','it may be desirable to constrain the possible values for the type attribute to a small set of possibilities. A schema modified in this way would no longer necessarily regard as valid the same set of documents as the corresponding unmodified TEI schema','but would remain faithful to the same conceptual model.This section explains how the TEI schema can be customized by suppressing elements','modifying classes of elements','or adding elements. Documents which validate against an application of the TEI schema which has been customized in this way may or may not be considered TEI-conformant','as further discussed in section CF (Conformance) .The TEI system is designed to support modification and customization in a documented way that can be validated by an XML processor. This is achieved by writing a small TEI-conformant document','known informally as an ODD (One Document Does it all)','from which an appropriate processor can generate both human-readable documentation','and a schema expressed in a language such as RELAX NG or DTD. The mechanisms used to instantiate a TEI schema differ for different schema languages','and are therefore not defined here. In XML DTDs','for example','extensive use is made of parameter entities','while in RELAX NG schemas','extensive use is made of patterns. In either case','the names of elements and','wherever possible','their attributes and content models are defined indirectly. The syntax used to implement this indirection also varies with the schema language used','but the underlying constructs in the TEI Abstract Model are given the same names. This indirection makes it simpler to implement customization of the TEI system in an accessible and human-readable way. As further discussed in section ST (The TEI Infrastructure) ','the TEI encoding schema comprises a set of class and macro declarations','and a number of modules. Each module is made up of element and attribute declarations','and a schema is made by combining a particular set of modules together. In the absence of any other kind of customization','when modules are combined together: all the elements defined by the module (and described in the corresponding section of these Guidelines) are included in the schema; each such element is identified by the canonical name given it in these Guidelines; the content model of each such element is as defined by these Guidelines; the names','datatypes','and permitted values declared for each attribute associated with each such element are as given in these Guidelines; the elements comprising element classes and the meaning of macro declarations expressed in terms of element classes is determined by the particular combination of modules selected. The TEI customization mechanisms allow the user to control this behaviour as follows: particular elements may be suppressed','removing them from any classes in which they are members','and also from any generated schema; new elements may be added to an existing class','thus making them available in macros or content models defined in terms of those classes; additional attributes','or attribute values','may be specified for an individual element or for classes of elements; within certain limits','attributes','or attribute values','may also be removed either from an individual element or for classes of elements; the characteristics inherited by one class from another class may be modified by modifying its class membership: all members of the class then inherit the changed characteristics; the set of values legal for an attribute or attribute class may be constrained or relaxed by supplying or modifying a value list','or by modifying its datatype. within certain limits','the name (generic identifier) associated with an element may be changed','without changing the semantic or syntactic properties of the element; The modification mechanisms presented in this section are quite general','and may be used to make all the types of changes just listed. The recommended way of implementing and documenting all such modifications is by means of the ODD system described in chapter TD (Documentation Elements) ; in the remainder of this section we give specific examples to illustrate how that system may be applied. An ODD processor','such as the Roma application supported by the TEI','or any other comparable set of stylesheets will use the declarations provided by an ODD to generate appropriate sets of declarations in a specific schema language such as RELAX NG or the XML DTD language. We do not discuss in detail here how this should be done','since the details are schema language-specific; some background information about the methods used for XML DTD and RELAX NG schema generation is however provided in section STIN (Defining a TEI Schema) . Several example ODD files are also provided as part of the standard TEI release: see further section MDlite (Examples of Modification) below.']",,,,

The author of a written text','its title or its date of publication','may all be regarded as characterizing it at least as strongly as any of the parameters discussed in this section. The rule of thumb applied has been to exclude from discussion here most of the information which generally forms part of a standard bibliographic style description','if only because such information has already been included elsewhere in the TEI header. The profileDesc element contains elements taken from the model.profileDescPart class. The default members of this class are the following : These elements are further described in the remainder of this section.When the corpus module described in chapter CC (Language Corpora) is included in a schema','three further elements become available within the profileDesc element: For descriptions of these elements','see section CCAH (Contextual Information) .When the transcr module for the transcription of primary sources described in chapter PH (Representation of Primary Sources) is included in a schema','the following elements become available within the profileDesc element: For a description of the handNotes element','see section PHDH (Document Hands) .

The handNote element can also appear within a structured manuscript description','when the msdescription module described in chapter MS (Manuscript Description) is included in a schema. For this reason','the handNote element is actually declared within the header module','but is only accessible to a schema when one or other of the transcr or msdescription modules is included in a schema.

Examples of such contextual information include: the age','sex','and geographical origins of participants in a language interaction','or their socio-economic status; the cost and publication data of a newspaper; the topic','register or factuality of an extract from a textbook. Such information may be of the first importance','whether as an organizing principle in creating a corpus (for example','to ensure that the range of values in such a parameter is evenly represented throughout the corpus','or represented proportionately to the population being sampled)','or as a selection criterion in analysing the corpus (for example','to investigate the language usage of some particular vector of social characteristics).Such contextual information is potentially of equal importance for unitary texts','and these Guidelines accordingly make no particular distinction between the kinds of information which should be gathered for unitary and for composite texts. In either case','the information should be recorded in the appropriate section of a TEI header','as described in chapter HD (The TEI Header) . In the case of language corpora','such information may be gathered together in the overall corpus header','or split across all the component texts of a corpus','in their individual headers','or divided between the two. The association between an individual corpus text and the contextual information applicable to it may be made in a number of ways','as further discussed in section CCAS (Associating Contextual Information with a Text) below.Chapter HD (The TEI Header) ','which should be read in conjunction with the present section','describes in full the range of elements available for the encoding of information relating to the electronic file itself','for example its bibliographic description and those of the source or sources from which it was derived (see section HD2 (The File Description) ); information about the encoding practices followed with the corpus','for example its design principles','editorial practices','reference system','etc. (see section HD5 (The Encoding Description) ); more detailed descriptive information about the creation and content of the corpus','such as the languages used within it and any descriptive classification system used (see section HD4 (The Profile Description) ); and version information documenting any changes made in the electronic text (see section HD6 (The Revision Description) ).In addition to the elements defined by chapter HD (The TEI Header) ','several other elements can be used in the TEI header if the additional module defined by this chapter is invoked. These additional tags make it possible to characterize the social or other situation within which a language interaction takes place or is experienced','the physical setting of a language interaction','and the participants in it. Though this information may be relevant to','and provided for','unitary texts as well as for collections or corpora','it is more often recorded for the components of systematically developed corpora than for isolated texts','and thus this module is referred to as being for language corpora.When the module defined in this chapter is included in a schema','a number of additional elements become available within the profileDesc element of the TEI header (discussed in section HD4 (The Profile Description) ).

For this reason','the TEI schema supports a variety of different approaches to solving similar problems','and also defines a much richer set of elements than is likely to be necessary in any given project. Furthermore','the TEI schema may be extended in well-defined and documented ways for texts that cannot be conveniently or appropriately encoded using what is provided. For these reasons','it is almost impossible to use the TEI schema without customizing it in some way. This section describes how the TEI encoding schema may be customized','and should be read in conjunction with chapter TD (Documentation Elements) ','which describes how a specific application of the TEI encoding schema should be documented. The documentation system described in that chapter is','like the rest of the TEI schema','independent of any particular schema or document type definition language. Formally speaking','these Guidelines provide both syntactic rules about how elements and attributes may be used in valid documents and semantic recommendations about what interpretation should be attached to a given syntactic construct. In this sense','they provide both a document type definition and a document type declaration. More exactly','we may distinguish between the TEI Abstract Model','which defines a set of related concepts','and the TEI schema which defines a set of syntactic rules and constraints. Many (though not all) of the semantic recommendations are provided solely as informal descriptive prose','though some of them are also enforced by means of such constructs as datatypes (see DTYPES (Datatype Specifications) )','or by schema constraints expressed using the Schematron language. Schematron constraints provide information about special kinds of validation errors dependent on conditional relationships','such as the invalidity of an attribute name or value on one element when another is present','or when','given a pair of attributes such as minOccurs and maxOccurs','the minimum value exceeds the maximum value. Schematron constraints also provide warnings when a particular element','attribute','or combination is to be deprecated in future releases of the TEI scheme','to alert users that the feature in question is no longer to be used after a certain date. Very rarely','TEI Schematron constraints offer warnings that do not explicitly break with the TEI but suggest a more efficient or less ambiguous encoding. Although the descriptions','validation errors','and warnings have been written with care','there will inevitably be cases where the intention of the contributors has not been conveyed with sufficient clarity to prevent users of these Guidelines from extending them in the sense of attaching slightly variant semantics to them. Beyond this unintentional semantic extension','some of the elements described can intentionally be used in a variety of ways; for example','the element note has an attribute type which can take on arbitrary string values','depending on how it is used in a document. A new type of note','therefore','requires no change in the existing model. On the other hand','for many applications','it may be desirable to constrain the possible values for the type attribute to a small set of possibilities. A schema modified in this way would no longer necessarily regard as valid the same set of documents as the corresponding unmodified TEI schema','but would remain faithful to the same conceptual model.This section explains how the TEI schema can be customized by suppressing elements','modifying classes of elements','or adding elements. Documents which validate against an application of the TEI schema which has been customized in this way may or may not be considered TEI-conformant','as further discussed in section CF (Conformance) .The TEI system is designed to support modification and customization in a documented way that can be validated by an XML processor. This is achieved by writing a small TEI-conformant document','known informally as an ODD (One Document Does it all)','from which an appropriate processor can generate both human-readable documentation','and a schema expressed in a language such as RELAX NG or DTD. The mechanisms used to instantiate a TEI schema differ for different schema languages','and are therefore not defined here. In XML DTDs','for example','extensive use is made of parameter entities','while in RELAX NG schemas','extensive use is made of patterns. In either case','the names of elements and','wherever possible','their attributes and content models are defined indirectly. The syntax used to implement this indirection also varies with the schema language used','but the underlying constructs in the TEI Abstract Model are given the same names. This indirection makes it simpler to implement customization of the TEI system in an accessible and human-readable way. As further discussed in section ST (The TEI Infrastructure) ','the TEI encoding schema comprises a set of class and macro declarations','and a number of modules. Each module is made up of element and attribute declarations','and a schema is made by combining a particular set of modules together. In the absence of any other kind of customization','when modules are combined together: all the elements defined by the module (and described in the corresponding section of these Guidelines) are included in the schema; each such element is identified by the canonical name given it in these Guidelines; the content model of each such element is as defined by these Guidelines; the names','datatypes','and permitted values declared for each attribute associated with each such element are as given in these Guidelines; the elements comprising element classes and the meaning of macro declarations expressed in terms of element classes is determined by the particular combination of modules selected. The TEI customization mechanisms allow the user to control this behaviour as follows: particular elements may be suppressed','removing them from any classes in which they are members','and also from any generated schema; new elements may be added to an existing class','thus making them available in macros or content models defined in terms of those classes; additional attributes','or attribute values','may be specified for an individual element or for classes of elements; within certain limits','attributes','or attribute values','may also be removed either from an individual element or for classes of elements; the characteristics inherited by one class from another class may be modified by modifying its class membership: all members of the class then inherit the changed characteristics; the set of values legal for an attribute or attribute class may be constrained or relaxed by supplying or modifying a value list','or by modifying its datatype. within certain limits','the name (generic identifier) associated with an element may be changed','without changing the semantic or syntactic properties of the element; The modification mechanisms presented in this section are quite general','and may be used to make all the types of changes just listed. The recommended way of implementing and documenting all such modifications is by means of the ODD system described in chapter TD (Documentation Elements) ; in the remainder of this section we give specific examples to illustrate how that system may be applied. An ODD processor','such as the Roma application supported by the TEI','or any other comparable set of stylesheets will use the declarations provided by an ODD to generate appropriate sets of declarations in a specific schema language such as RELAX NG or the XML DTD language. We do not discuss in detail here how this should be done','since the details are schema language-specific; some background information about the methods used for XML DTD and RELAX NG schema generation is however provided in section STIN (Defining a TEI Schema) . Several example ODD files are also provided as part of the standard TEI release: see further section MDlite (Examples of Modification) below.']","['ND-org','SASOstdf','MD','NDATTS']",,,"['Information about a person','as distinct from references to a person','for example by name','is grouped together within a person element. Information about a group of people regarded as a single entity (for example the audience of a performance) may be encoded using the personGrp element.

When however a more detailed encoding is required for all kinds of information about a person','for example in a historical gazetteer','then it will be more appropriate to use the elements age','sex and others described elsewhere in this chapter.Note that the age attribute is not intended to record the person's age expressed in years','months','or other temporal unit. Rather it is intended to record into which age bracket','for the purposes of some analysis','the person falls. A simple (perhaps too simple to be useful) binary classification of age brackets would be child and adult. The actual age brackets useful to various projects are likely to be varied and idiosyncratic','and thus these Guidelines make no particular recommendation as to possible values.
